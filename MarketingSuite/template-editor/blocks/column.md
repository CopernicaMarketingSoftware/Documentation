# Columns block

The **columns block** allows you to split your mailing into two or more different
columns. Once you created your columns, you can drag any other block into these 
columns. 

Directly after you dropped the **columns block** into position, you will be 
prompted to choose the number of columns. Clicking on one of the options will 
directly create these columns. You can now drop any other item into these columns.

You can add as many **column blocks** to your email as needed. Just like any 
other block type, you can rearrange the position of a **columns block** by 
dragging it and drop it at any other location in your design where it says 
'drop here'. 

## Responsiveness of columns

On smaller devices (mobile phones) the columns and its containing blocks will 
be stacked vertically and become full width (100%). 

## Columns background color

Unlike other types of blocks, the **columns block** doesn't come with its own 
settings panel. You can change the background color of a column (or multiple 
columns) by selecting a block inside it. In the tab **Background** of that block 
you will find the options for setting the background color for that specific 
block, or its containing column or row.

## Nesting columns and changing columns
In the current version of the editor it is not possible to drag new columns into
an already existing column. Nor is it posible to change the number of columns of 
a **columns block** that was already added to the canvas. If you want to merge 
two columns together that already has content, it works best to drag a new 
**columns block** underneath it, and then move the content of the first block 
to the one below.
