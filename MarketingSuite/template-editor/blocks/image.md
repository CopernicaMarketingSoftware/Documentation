# Image block

Add images to your email design. After dropping the **image block** onto the 
canvas, you can choose the image and further configure it from the settings 
panel.

The image can be imported by uploading it from your computer, or by specifying 
the online location of the image. Images will be automatically stored on our 
servers to ensure that the image remains available in your emails, even when 
they are opened in a distant future.

Options for the image's appearance and to make it clickable can also be found in 
the side panel. 

You can only import images of type `.gif`, `.jpg` and `.png`. These are the most 
safe image types for use on the web.

# Image size

Optionally you can specify the width of an image. This allows you to make 
the image smaller than the container that it is placed in. If you do not set 
the width, the image will be shown in it's actual size. Images in an email will 
never become bigger than the container they are placed in, even if the real 
image file is bigger than the available space. This means that an image in an 
email can never exceed 580 pixels, because that it the max size of the email 
content. 

When resizing, the software only scales the image for you, meaning that it is 
not actually resized and compressed. A 4mb image will remain a 4mb image. Make 
sure to resize large images before uploading it, as it is not yet possible to 
edit, scale, crop or adjust images in the editor (we are working on this of 
course).
