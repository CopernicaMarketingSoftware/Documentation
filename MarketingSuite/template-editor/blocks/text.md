# Text / HTML block

The **text block** allows you to add large chunks of text to your email design. 
Using a *Rich Text Editor* you can make paragraphs, headers, change colors, 
add hyperlinks et cetera.  

If you are however more comfortable with writing HTML or just want more control 
about the HTML that is outputted, you can switch to the HTML source by clicking 
on the **Source** button inside the Rich Text Editor. 

Although you are allowed to add any HTML inside the *source* box, we advice to 
only use basic HTML as advanced HTML may break the email layout in some email 
clients.
