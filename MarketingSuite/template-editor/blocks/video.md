# Video block 

The *video block* provides the ability to add videos to your emails. Because 
embedding videos is disabled by most email clients, the editor will show 
a clickable screenshot of the video instead. When it is clicked, the user will 
either be sent to the website hosting the video, or -if specified- a custom 
landing page. 

When loaded inside the webversion, the actual video can be embedded inside the 
page or the thumbnail of the video can be shown.

At the moment, only videos hosted on Youtube.com and Vimeo.com are supported, 
but more video sites will be included in the near future.
