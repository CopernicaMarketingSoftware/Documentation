# Template basics

Ofcourse you already know what an email is, therefore we will not document
all email basics as there are plenty of online resources for this. Assuming
you are known with the basics, we still want to remind you of the following:


## Template header
The sender details and subject of your email are just as important as the
actual content of your email. Make sure that your subscribers know it is you, 
just by looking at the details. Just with the content
of your email, make sure there are no misspellings in your subject line. Spammy words (buy now!, Free!,
viagra) are big spam flags, as are ALL CAPS and exclamation marks!!!!!!!!!!!!!.


## Text version
The text version is a text-only version of your email that is automatically sent
along with the HTML version. Sending HTML only email is not well received by ESPs. Also, nowadays some
email clients show a popup notification when a new email arrives. The text
version of your email is automatically shown within some of these popup
notifications. This is another reason why you should care about the text
version of your email.


## Attachments
Even though we support attachments, our best advice: Don't use attachements
in your mass mailings. Those that send a large volumes of emails that include attachments
typically are spammers.

Aside of a bigger risk of being flagged as a spammer, not all recipients
might have enough space in their mailbox to receive large emails with the
consequence, the email is rejected (bounced with mailbox full error).

## Preview template
You can preview your email template within the template editor which shows
you an accurate depiction of how emails sent with this template would render
in the subscriber's email client. In the top left corner of the 'preview mode'
you will find some device icons to visualize the template on various screen
sizes.

There's also a print button, in case you want to send your newsletter by
postal service. Don't forget to stamp the envelope sufficient before sending.
