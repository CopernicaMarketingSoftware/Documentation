## Preview template
You can preview your email template within the template editor which shows you an accurate depiction of how emails sent with this template would render in the subscriber's email client. In the top left corner of the 'preview mode' you will find some device icons to visualize the template on various screen sizes.

There's also a print button, in case you want to send your newsletter by postal service. Don't forget to stamp the envelope sufficient before sending.
