# Adding link parameters

The template editor allows you to add campaign parameters to your links using 
the extend link option. This allows you to identify the campaigns that send 
traffic to your website by adding tags to your links. A populair example of 
link extension is the 
[Google Analytics URL builder](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033867 "Google Analytics URL builder").
Adding these so called UTM codes to your links allows you to filter 
on traffic from specific campaigns in Google Analytics. 

It is also possible to add custom tags and parameters to links using the 
'custom parameters' tab. This is for users that want to add their own 
parameters or use a different campaign tag monitor. 

All fields within the link extension menu allow for [personalization using smarty-code](copernica-docs:MarketingSuite/template-editor/personalization "Personalization documentation").
