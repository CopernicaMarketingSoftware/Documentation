# Adding link parameters

The template editor allows you to add campaign parameters to your links using 
the extend link option. This allows you to identify the campaigns that send 
traffic to your website by adding tags to your links. A populair example of 
link extension is the 
[Google Analytics URL builder](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033867 "Google Analytics URL builder").
Adding these paremeters (also known as UTM codes for Google Analytics) to 
your links allows you to filter on traffic from specific campaigns in 
Google Analytics. 

It is also possible to add custom tags and parameters to links using the 
'custom parameters' tab. This is for users that want to add their own 
parameters or use a different campaign tag monitor. 

The extend link option only works when your template has links. Link extension
can be set per website. This makes it possible to add different parameters 
for different websites. 

All fields within the link extension menu allow for [personalization using smarty-code](copernica-docs:MarketingSuite/template-editor/personalization "Personalization documentation").
