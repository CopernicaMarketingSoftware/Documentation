# Template source

In the template menu, you'll see an item **source**. Clicking this item will not bring you tothe HTML source of the email (as you probably expected), but to the **JSON** source of the template. JSON? Let us elaborate. 

JSON is a computer thingy to describe and store information in a structured way. It is quite similar to the more widely known format XML.

The template editor is built on a webservice that is able to read JSON, and transform it into the HTML that can be read by email clients.   

Actually, this webservice is built by us, and more information about that can be found on [www.responsiveemail.com](www.responsiveemail.com). 

In source mode, you can manually alter the JSON code. If you are familiar with the JSON structure, 
it might in some cases more comfortable to direcly edit the JSON source, instead of using the
drag and drop editor. 

You can store the JSON source on your local computer, to create a backup of your email design.
