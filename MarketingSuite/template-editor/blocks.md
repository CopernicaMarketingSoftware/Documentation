# Blocks

The drag and drop editor enables you to create email designs from smaller fragments called 
**blocks**. 

There are couple of different types of blocks available:

- [Button block](copernica-docs:MarketingSuite/template-editor/blocks/button)
- [Column block](copernica-docs:MarketingSuite/template-editor/blocks/column)
- [Heading block](copernica-docs:MarketingSuite/template-editor/blocks/heading)
- [Image block](copernica-docs:MarketingSuite/template-editor/blocks/image)
- [Separator block](copernica-docs:MarketingSuite/template-editor/blocks/separator)
- [Spacer block](copernica-docs:MarketingSuite/template-editor/blocks/spacer)
- [Text block](copernica-docs:MarketingSuite/template-editor/blocks/text)
- [Video block](copernica-docs:MarketingSuite/template-editor/blocks/video)
- [Webversion block](copernica-docs:MarketingSuite/template-editor/blocks/webversion)

## Adding blocks

To add blocks to the canvas, just drag an item from toolbox to the template 
canvas and drop it at any location where it says 'Drop here'. Once it is 
dropped into position you can directly further edit the block properties from 
the right settings panel. Blocks dragged onto the canvas can easily be edited 
or rearranged using the same drag 'n dropping technique. 

## Change block position

To rearrange the location of a block, click on it and start dragging it to 
the new position. 

## Deleting a block

Blocks can be easily removed from your canvas. While dragging an item, you will 
see that the toolbox becomes one big trashcan. Drag the block into the dumpster 
to remove the block.
