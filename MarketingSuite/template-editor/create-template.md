# Creating a template.

There are a few ways of creating a new email template. The most easy way to create a new email template 
is, once logged in the MarketingSuite, by clicking on the 'new template' link. You will be prompted what 
you would like to do.

The editor makes it possible to start with a **blank template** or by using a **prefabricated / example 
template** so you have a head start on how your template could look like. The example templates are the ones 
you can also find and download for free on [ResponsiveEmail.com](https://www.responsiveemail.com).

### Cloning an existing template
Aside of the above described possibilities you could also opt to clone an existing template to only modify 
it's content. In some cases this could save you allot of time. To clone a template open the template in the editor and go in the top menu to Template -> Clone.

Just like cloning, if you already have a template JSON, you can open the editor (new blank template), in the top menu go to Template -> Source to open the JSON Editor and paste your JSON. Don't forget to hit the save button.
