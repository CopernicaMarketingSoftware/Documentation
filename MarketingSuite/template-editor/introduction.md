# Template Editor

It has never been easier to create your email templates without any knowledge of HTML. This editor uses a state of the art 'drag & drop' workflow which makes it easy to position desired elements (images, buttons, text, etc, etc) in your email templates. 

As a bonus, the generated emails are responsive out of the box! No more cursing and headaches, hacking your css to get your template responsive and working in different email clients.

The editor renders templates under the hood using [ResponsiveEmail.com](https://www.responsiveemail.com) which is based on JSON input. For advanced users the editor includes a JSON editor to take full control of the generated template. The json templates render multiple times faster than the Publisher templates making large emailings to be send out faster.
