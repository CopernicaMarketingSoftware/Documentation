# Template Editor overview

The template editor allows you to design and put together your own emails 
templates without having to write any HTML or CSS code yourself. It uses
a simple drag and drop system, which can be used to drag content into your
email template. The user interface of the editor consists of 4 main parts:

1. [Toolbox](copernica-docs:MarketingSuite/template-editor/ui/toolbox)

   Drag any item from this toolbox onto your screen. While dragging, this toolbox will contain options related to the item or block that is being dragged.  
   
2. [Canvas](copernica-docs:MarketingSuite/template-editor/ui/canvas)

   This is the workspace that you will be using to compose your emailing templates. Drag items from the toolbox onto the canvas to use them as blocks in your template.  
   
3. [Settings](copernica-docs:MarketingSuite/template-editor/ui/settings)

   The Settings panel contains all the settings directly related to the active block.    
   
4. [Topbar](copernica-docs:MarketingSuite/template-editor/ui/top-bar)

   Quick access to basic actions, such as saving your template, previewing, setup a mass mailing and so forth.
