# Repeating emailings
In the Marketing Suite, it's possible to set emailings to be sent not only directly 
after creation, but also at a specific point in time, or with a specific time interval. 
This is useful for when you want to schedule a bunch of mailings for different dates 
in one sitting, or if you want your mails to be sent once in a while, e.g. mails with 
special offers or highlighted articles based on customer interests. 

There are four main categories of scheduled mailings:
- mailings that are sent immediately
- mailings to be sent on a specific date
- mailings that are repeated monthly or weekly
- mailings that are repeated with a specific time based interval

These are also the four options you've got when opening the date-wizard in the dashboard.

##Mailings with specific dates
Mailings that are sent immediately and mailings that are sent on a speficic date are straightforward: simply select the option that applies and use the calendar (or your keyboard) to select the date on which the mailing should be sent.

##Repeated mailings
Repeated mailings have some more options. The first option is to send a mailing on a set day every week or month. For example: Every Wednesday and Friday at 3PM. Or: Every second Tuesday of the month at 5PM. You might want to use this for things like newsletters or scheduling recurring meetings that always take place at the same day of the month.

The second option is to send them with a specific interval, in which you set the time in between mailings, e.g. every 30 days, or every 3 months. This is useful for things like notifying customers about things that need to be paid once in a specific period, et cetera.

In both cases, it's possible to select a time for the first mailing and one for the last mailing. If you don't want the mailing to ever stop repeating, just leave the 'last mailing' field blank.

Repeated maillings are often used for mailings with dynamic content. Think of automatically generated newsletters with the most popular articles of the month, or a mailing with products that the recipient might find interesting, based on their interests in the database.
