# Sending an emailing

To send a massmailing to a mailing list, click on **Send emailing** in 
the top bar. This will bring you to the mass mailing settings, where you set 
the target, the timestamp and the other related settings. 

## Choosing the target of the emailing. 

The target of an emailing can be an entire database, a selection, a collection,
a miniselection or a Magento target.

These targets are not created in the template editor, but in the old Publisher 
environment. [Creating mailinglists using selections in the old Publisher environment](https://www.copernica.com/en/blog/selections-and-miniselections).

Targets created in Publisher are automatically available in the template editor 
when setting up a mailing.

## Date and time of sending

By default, a mailing will be sent immediately after you hit the **confirm and 
send** button in the final step. Alternatively you can choose to schedule 
the mailing on a future date or/and to automatically repeat the mailing with 
a specific interval.

To schedule and/or repeat the mailing, click the link at the **Date and Time** 
section when settings up a new mailing. 

## Review mailing settings

Before you finally send a mailing, we let you perform a final check on all 
the settings first. In case you stumble upon an error or mistake, click 
the related **Edit** button to make your adjustment.

## Sending the mailing

You can now finally send your mailing. Hit the **Send** button on the preview 
page to start the mailing. Your mailing will start sending immediately or be 
scheduled if you've chose to send it in the future.  

## Cancelling or editing a scheduled mailing

Setting of scheduled mailings that haven't started sending yet can be cancelled 
or edited. 

## Changing template content 

After you've setup a scheduled mailing, you can still make modifications to 
the template, for example to change its content or improve typos. The final 
version of the email template will be sent.
