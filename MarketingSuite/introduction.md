# Introduction

The Copernica Marketing Suite is Copernica's application for building 
rich and powerful email campaigns.

## New to MS?
If you're just starting out with Copernica Marketing Software, you might benefit from our 
[Marketing Suite starter guide](starter-guide.).

## Drag and drop Template Editor

Composing rich email messages in the Marketing Suite does not require 
any knowledge of HTML and CSS. The Marketing Suite has an easy to use 
drag-and-drop editor, meaning that you no longer need specific skills to
create emails: it is just a matter of dragging and dropping content onto
the template canvas.

## Sending a mailing

After creating your email you can use the Marketing Suite send interface
to set up your email campaign. Pick any target selection from your 
database and start sending right away, or schedule your campaigns for 
another time.

## Email reports

For every email sent the Marketing Suite keeps detailed reports. Track 
opens, clicks and see your open- and click-through rate. Detailed graphs
show you exactly when and on what device your subscribers opened or 
clicked in your emails.

## Magento integration

For users with a Magento webshop the Marketing Suite has a built-in 
[Magento](http://magento.com) integration. This integration synchronizes
the data in your Magento webshop with a Copernica database that is 
specially designed for Magento. This makes it easy to set up email 
campaigns based on data from your Magento webshop.

### Things you still have to do in the old Publisher environment 

The Copernica Marketing Suite is under constant development. If you 
landed on this page, you probably also have access to (and maybe have 
worked in) the old Copernica Publisher environment. Copernica Publisher 
will eventually be fully replaced by this Copernica Marketing Suite.

However, things like managing your lists, unsubscribe behaviour, 
creating web forms, landing pages and creating emails with advanced 
personalization options are not possible in the Copernica Marketing 
Suite and still need to be done in the old software.

The old Publisher environment can be accessed via 
[publisher.copernica.com](https://publisher.copernica.com) and requires
the same login credentials.  

If your login credentials don't give you access to publisher.copernica.com, 
please get in touch with our support department via 
[support@copernica.com](mailto:support@copernica.com).
