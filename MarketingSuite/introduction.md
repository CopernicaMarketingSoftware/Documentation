# Introduction

The Copernica Marketing Suite is Copernica's brand new application for building rich and 
powerful email campaigns. Whilst the Marketing Suite is fully equipped to help you send and create email marketing campaigns, it is not feature complete yet and we are constantly 
working hard on adding new and more advanced features. 

If you have any questions or suggestions feel free to send a message
to [Richard Hordijk](mailto:richard.hordijk@copernica.com).

## Drag and drop Template Editor

Composing rich email messages in the Marketing Suite does not require any knowledge
of HTML and CSS. The Marketing Suite has an easy to use drag-and-drop editor, meaning that you no longer need specific skills to create emails: it is just a matter of dragging and dropping content onto the template canvas.

## Sending a mailing

After creating your email you can use the Marketing Suite send interface to set up
your email campaign. Pick any target selection from your database and start sending 
right away, or schedule your campaigns for another time.

## Email reports

For every email sent the Marketing Suite keeps detailed reports. Track opens, clicks and 
see your open- and click-through rate. Detailed graphs show you exactly when and on what device 
your subscribers opened or clicked in your emails.

## Magento integration

For users with a Magento webshop the Marketing Suite has a built-in [Magento](http://magento.com) integration. This integration synchronizes the data in your Magento webshop with a database that is specially designed for Magento. This makes it easy to set up email campaigns based on data from your Magento webshop.

### Things you still have to do in the old Publisher environment 

If you landed on this page, you probably have access to (and maybe also worked in) the Publisher environment. Publisher will eventually replaced by the Copernica Marketing Suite, of which this drag and drop template editor is just a tiny part. Replacing this extensive but outdated software package obviously takes some time. 

Things like managing your lists, unsubscribe behaviour, creating web forms, landing pages, creating emails with advanced personalization are not possible in the Copernica Marketing Suite and still need to be done in the old software.

The old Publisher environment can be accessed via [publisher.copernica.com](https://publisher.copernica.com) and requires the same login credentials.  

If your login credentials don't give you access to publisher.copernica.com, please get in touch with our support department via [support@copernica.com](mailto:support@copernica.com).
