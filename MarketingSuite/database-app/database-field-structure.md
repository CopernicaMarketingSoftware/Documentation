#Database field structure

A database is built with fields to store pieces of information about the profiles inside the database. Typical fields in a database used for mailings are fields to store *email*, *first name*, *last name* and so forth. 

The way how a database is built with fields we call the Database Structure. To start adding fields to your database:

- In the overview of the database, go to the tab **Options**
- Click the button **Edit structure** to go to the Edit Structure tool.
- Click on **Create field** to create the first field. 

After storing the new field, it will appear in the main overview. You can add a second
field by clicking **Add field** under the newly created field in the overview.

Tip: To subsequently add fields, just hit the Enter button when the first is created.
