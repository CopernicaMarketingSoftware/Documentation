#MarketingSuite Database App

A new account of the Marketing Suite is delivered almost empty and thus without any databases. To send a mailing, you must first create a database wherein you store information about the destinations of your future mailings.

You can create and manage the databases of your account in the section **Databases** (http://ms.copernica.com/#/databases)   

From here you will be able to create databases and/or view and edit your current databases, its structure and selections. Also, you can lookup the mailings that are sent and scheduled to a database and its selections. 

When creating a new database, it will have zero fields and no structure. You are free to structure your database any way you like. There is no limit on the number of database fields that you can add. 

##Creating a database

Creating a database is done in a few simple steps. 

- Click on 'Databases' in the side menu to go to Database Management
- Click on 'Add database' in the top-right corner. 
- Choose a name for your database and optionally enter a description for your new database. 
- Click the create button to create the database. 

The dialog will close and the overview page for the new database will be opened. 

The newly created database is of course empty. It has no structure yet and no information 
has been stored in it.
