To send mailings with the MarketingSuite, you need a database. 

##Creating a database

Creating a database is done in a few simple steps. 

- Go to the database management tool by clicking **Databases** in the side menu.
- Click on **Add database** in the top-right corner. 
- Choose a name for your database and optionally enter a description for your new database. 
- Click the **Confirm** button to create the database. 

The dialog will close and the overview page for the new database will be opened. 

The newly created database is of course empty. It has no field structure yet and no information 
has been stored in it.
