# Magento quotes list

A Magento *quote* represents the content of a shopping cart. 
Theoretically the quote is an offer and if the user accepts it (by checking out) it converts to an order. 

The *Quotes* list provides targets that are quotes. Note that only quotes that 
have access to an email address are synchronized.
