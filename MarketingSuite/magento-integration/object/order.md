# Order object

When a customer decides that he added all needed products inside his basket and 
goes through checkout, an order is created. An order is a finalized [quote](copernica-docs:MarketingSuite/magento-integration/object/quote).

The object `order` gives you access to the properties of an order, such as 
the quantity, items and the customer who placed the order.  

## State and status

`state` and `status` properties sound very similar. And indeed, they _are_ very
similar. They both describe the current order progress. `state` is used by Magento
internally. `status` is a value defined inside the Magento admin panel by the administrator.

Multiple `status` codes can be assigned to one `state` code.

### State values

`state` property can hold one of following values:

* 'new'

  When an order was placed it is assigned with the 'new' state.
  
* 'pending_payment'
    
  This state will show up when there is a payment being processed by an outside payment
  gateway (like PayPal or Authorizenet).
    
* 'processing'

  This state will show up when a new invoice is created for the order.
  
* 'complete'

  This state describes a fully processed order. When order contains shippable 
  items, shipments for all items have to be created. Also, the customer has to 
  be invoiced.
  
* 'closed'
  
  This state will show up when an order is successfully refunded.
  
* 'canceled'
  
  This state will show up when an order is successfully cancelled.
  
* 'holded'
  
  This state will show up when an order is put on hold.
    
* 'payment_review'

  This state will show up when a payment is being reviewed or pending review inside Magento.
