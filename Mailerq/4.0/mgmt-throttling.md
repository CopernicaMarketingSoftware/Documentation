# Management Console: Email throttling view

Setting up email throttling can be done in the MailerQ Management Console. 
All throttling settings can be adjusted in real-time, making it easy to 
improve your email delivery when needed. You can choose to set up 
throttling settings for a single domain for all IP addresses or for all 
IP addresses.

Read more about setting up domain specific limits and other delivery settings in 
our [delivery throttling documentation](delivery-limits#domain-specific-limits).
<!-- TODO: put this information here, and split delivery-limits into config and 
MGMT parts. -->

# Flood patterns view

Flood patterns are rules that override the default throttling settings 
of MailerQ when the Mail Transfer Agent receives a specific error from a
receiving mail server.

Read more about setting up flood patterns and other delivery settings in our
[delivery throttling documentation](delivery-limits#flood-patterns).
