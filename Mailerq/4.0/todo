config options to add to documentation:
    "server-id",
    "max-threads",
    "max-connections",
    "max-messages",
    "max-queues",
    "max-memory",
    "www-host",
    "smtp-privatekey",
    "dns-threads",
    "config-file",
    "envelope"


Two pages use a different default amount of times a message is re-sent:
unlimited in json-messages.md   maxattempts
6         in mime-headers.md    x-mq-maxattempts


mime-headers.md in Delivery time section seems to hint at a default value
for x-mq-delayed, but this isn't available in the config file
