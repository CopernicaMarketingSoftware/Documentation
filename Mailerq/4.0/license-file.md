# License file

To run MailerQ, you need a valid license file. This file contains the list
of IP addresses from which you are going to send out mail, and the features
that should be enabled. You can get a license file from the MailerQ website.

It is best to store your license file as `etc/mailerq/license.txt`. If you
store it in a different location, you also have to update your config file.

If you have questions about your license, feel free to send an email to 
[info@mailerq.com](mailto:info@mailerq.com).
