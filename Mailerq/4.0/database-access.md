# The MailerQ database

MailerQ uses a relational database to store all sorts of configuration 
data and delivery settings. The data stored in the database includes
for example the delivery throttles and DKIM Keys. The database is read
and updated by MailerQ, but you are free to write your own scripts and
programs that also modify this data.

MailerQ supports multiple database platforms. Currently, we support
MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL and SQLite databases. The SQLite database is by far 
the simplest to set up because it does not require a server process to
run. All you need is the "sqlite3" library to be installed on your system.

The other database systems, MySQL, MariaDB and PostgreSQL, take a little
more effort, but are not too difficult to install either. You only 
need to create the database and put the login and password in the 
MailerQ configuration file. MailerQ does the rest and creates all
tables.


## Database settings in the config file

Only one variable has to be set in the config file to connect to a
database: the "database" variable:

```
database:           sqlite:///path/to/database/file.sql
database:           mysql://user:password@hostname/databasename
database:           postgresql://user:password@hostname/databasename
```

SQLite is the simplest database to set up, because you just specify the 
path to a file on the MailerQ server (this file does not even have to 
exist). However, an SQLite database can not be used if you want to access
the same database from multiple machines.

If you do use SQLite, note that you need three (!) slashes in
the address: the "sqlite://" prefix, followed by the "/path/to/database".

MailerQ automatically creates or alters missing or incomplete tables. 
If you use a MySQL, MariaDB or PostgreSQL database, make sure that the 
database exists, and that MailerQ not only gets enough privileges to read 
and write from and to the database, but also to create and modify tables.


## Choosing the right engine

From a performance perspective it does not really matter which database
engine you choose to use. MailerQ periodically (every ten minutes)
copies all settings from the database to main memory, and uses this in-memory
cache for lookups. No realtime queries are executed, and no connections are kept
open to the database in between these reloads. The speed of the database does
therefore not have to be a factor in choosing the most appropriate engine. 
It is better to choose a database that you feel most comfortable with.
Do you already use MySQL databases? Then it is best to use it for MailerQ
too. Do you run a single MailerQ instance, and does data not have to be
shared amongst multiple MailerQ instances? Then the SQLite database is sufficient.

MailerQ makes use of client libraries to connect to the database. To
connect to a MySQL or MariaDB database, you must make sure that either 
libmysqlclient or libmariadbclient is installed on your system. For
PostgreSql connections libpq has to be installed, and libsqlite3 is needed
for SQLite3 databases. If these libraries are not available on the system,
it is not possible to connect to the database.


## Rebuilding the database

When MailerQ starts, it first connects to the database and checks whether
all tables are in a valid state. Tables that do not exist are created,
and tables that miss columns are automatically altered and the missing
columns are added. This automatic table-checking is done every time
MailerQ starts up.

Normally, the only time when tables are created is the very first
time that you start MailerQ, and the only time when tables are altered 
is after upgrading to a new MailerQ version that uses a slightly different 
database schema.

If you want to enforce that all tables in the database are dropped and
replaced by brand new empty tables, you can start MailerQ with the 
"--purge-database" command line option:

```bash
$ mailerq --purge-database
```

This option tells MailerQ not to check and repair tables, but to drop
them all and create new ones.


## Multiple MailerQ instances

It is possible to run multiple MailerQ instances that all connect to the
same database. If you do this, we recommend setting up a [cluster](cluster)
of MailerQ instances too. The different MailerQ instances then notify each
other every time the settings in the database are updated, so that each
instance can update its cache.


## Reading and writing to the database directly

MailerQ has a powerful [web based MTA management console](management-console "Management console"). 
This console gives you access to the database using simple web forms. 
It is therefore in normal operations not at all necessary to run any 
queries on the database by yourself. But if you do like to access the data
you are free to do so.

All tables in the database have a very straight forward structure. 
Because MailerQ is compatible with many different database systems, we do 
not use vendor specific SQL features and we've kept all tables as simple
as possible. The tables use well known data types, and no foreign 
keys or constraints. Booleans are stored as integers and "NULL" and "0" values 
have the same semantics. The value "0" is often used to set something to 
"unlimited"

The following tables are created:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>capacity</td>
        <td>delivery limits</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>flood_responses</td>
        <td>alternative delivery limits to use when certain responses come in</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>IPs</td>
        <td>all MailerQ's IP addresses</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>dkim_keys</td>
        <td>DKIM Keys to sign outgoing mails</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>dkim_patterns</td>
        <td>rules that decide what DKIM Keys to use</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>locals</td>
        <td>Local Email Addresses</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>delegates</td>
        <td>rules to send mail from a different IP</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>paused</td>
        <td>deliveries on pause</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>mtanames</td>
        <td>alternative "EHLO" names</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>dns</td>
        <td>overridden dns lookups</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Most tables are pretty self-explanatory, and every table can be filled by
using the management console. We'll give a short explanation of each table here.

### The capacity table

All delivery capacities are stored in this "capacity" table. It for example
holds the max number of connections that may be set up to a certain
domain, or the max number of messages to send within a minute.

The "localip" and "domain" columns  in this table can both be empty. If they are empty, the
setting applies to all local IPs and/or all domains. Only the most specific
record is used. Thus, if a mail is sent from IP 1.2.3.4 to domain example.com,
the record with the same localip and same domain is used. If no such 
record exists, MailerQ looks for a record that only matches the domain or 
the IP (and for which the other field is empty). If that record
also does not exist, the record for which both the domain and the IP are
empty is used.

The best way to get an understanding of the column in this table is to
play around with the management console, and see what kind of data ends
up in this table.


### The flood_responses table

The "flood_responses" table has an almost similar layout as the capacity table,
but with a "pattern" and a "type" column instead of an IP address and a domain.
For each failed delivery, the answer message from the remote server is checked
agains the patterns in this table. If there is a match, MailerQ will start
using the delivery capacity set in this table.

For example, if you insert a record in this table with pattern "flood detected"
and type "substr", and MailerQ receives an answer from a remote server
which a message like "message rejected, flood detected from your IP address",
MailerQ automatically switches the send capacity to the associated capacity. 

Once again, the best way to get an idea of the meaning of the columns is
to just experiment with the management console, and then look at the data
in this table.


### The IPs table

On startup, MailerQ detects all IP addresses that are linked to the server,
and stores these IP addresses in a database table. MailerQ does not use this
table for queries or for anything, it is just created so that other
programs or scripts can find out which IP addresses are available for sending 
out emails.


### The DKIM Keys and Patterns

All DKIM private keys that are used for signing outgoing mails are stored 
in the "dkim_keys" table. Only the domain, the selector and the expire time for
the signature are stored; other properties are retrieved from DNS.

To decide what keys should be used for outgoing emails, there is a separate
"dkim_patterns" table. The from address of every outgoing mail is compared
to the records in this table, and whenever there is a match, the associated
key is used for a DKIM signature.

The pattern type can be "regex", "fnmatch", "substr" or "exact", and decides
whether the "sign" column holds a regular expression, or some other kind
of pattern.


### Local Email Addresses

Incoming mails are compared with the addresses stored in the local email
address table. When there is a match, the mail is not sent to the regular
inbox RabbitMQ message queue, but to the locals queue instead. The "type"
column can be set to "regex", "fnmatch", "substr" and "exact".


### Delegates

If you want to send mail from a different IP address than is stored in
the message JSON, you can use the "delegates" table. For example, if you
notice that "example.com" no longer accepts incoming connections from
your "1.2.3.4" address, but that it does accept connections from "1.2.3.5",
you can add a row to the "delegates" table. This row instructs MailerQ
that it should send all mail that was originalle planned to be sent from
"1.2.3.4" to "example.com" to be sent from address "1.2.3.5" instead.


### Paused Deliveries

To pause deliveries from and/or to IP addresses or domains, you can insert
records in the "paused" table. The "target" column in this table can hold
IP addresses, domain names and empty values. The "localip" column is
of course only used for IP addresses, but may also hold empty strings.

If you want to pause all deliveries from your own IP address "1.2.3.4"
to "example.com", you can simply insert such a record in the "paused"
table. An empty value in one of the columns of the "paused" table means that 
all deliveries are paused. For example, if you insert an empty domain and IP 
address "1.2.3.4", MailerQ pauses all deliveries from "1.2.3.4", no matter to 
what domain they should be sent. If you insert a record with an empty domain 
and IP "5.6.7.8" as target, all deliveries to IP address "5.6.7.8" will be 
put on hold.


### The mtanames tables

By default, MailerQ does a reverse DNS lookup to find the hostname of
its local IP addresses. This hostname is the name used in the "HELO/EHLO"
SMTP handshake. If you want to use a different hostname instead, you can
insert a row into this table.


### Custom DNS lookups

To override the DNS resolver, you can add records to the "dns" table. MailerQ
normally uses normal DNS queries to find out to which IP addresses mail should
be sent. First it does a MX query to find the MX records, and then for each
MX record MailerQ looks for the associated A or AAAA records to find the
IP addresses.

However, in case you want to bypass these lookups for specific IP addresses,
you can add records to the "dns" table. If matching records are available,
MailerQ uses the IP addresses in these records instead of doing the DNS
queries. This feature can for example be useful if you know that certain
domains (like the ones that you own yourself) have special IP addresses on 
which they receive email, besides the ones that are announced in DNS.
