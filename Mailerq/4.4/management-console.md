# Mail Transfer Agent Management Console

MailerQ comes equipped with a full MTA management console. The management
console allows you to monitor the performance of your email delivery in 
real-time. If necessary, the management console can be used to change 
settings to maximize deliverability on the fly. If you have multiple 
instances of MailerQ running in a cluster, you can easily switch between 
them.

Documentation on the Management Console has been split up in the following parts.

* [Setting up the management console](mgmt-setup "Setup of the management console")
