# Advanced Configuration

MailerQ can be configured using the "/etc/mailerq/config.txt" config file. 
Most of the variables and settings in this config file are discussed in 
separate articles. However, the following settings are not mentioned
anywhere else:

````
max-delivertime:        86400
max-attempts:           0
retry-interval:         600,600,1800,1800,3600,3600,7200
server-id:              1
license:                /path/to/license.txt
user:                   username
lock:                   /path/to/lock.txt
````

Most of the settings speak for themselves. A small overview.


## Max deliver time

When a mail gets greylisted, or when there is an other type of soft failure, 
MailerQ reschedules the mail for later delivery. Inside the JSON data
of each message you can add the optional properties "maxdelivertime" and 
"maxattempts" that instruct MailerQ how long it should retry to deliver
the message, and when it should give up trying.

If you do not include these properties, MailerQ falls back to the 
"max-delivertime" and "max-attempts" config file settings. The 
"max-delivertime" variable holds the number of seconds MailerQ should keep
on trying after the message was consumed for the first time. The "max-attempts" 
setting holds the total number of attempts before giving up.

You should normally set the "max-attempts" value to 0, meaning unlimited.
MailerQ will then only give up after the number of seconds set in the
"max-delivertime" variable, no matter how many attempts are made. 


## Retry interval

If a mail is published back to the outbox queue to be tried again, MailerQ 
uses the "retries" property in the JSON to find out how long it should wait 
for the next attempt. Because this setting is JSON based, it is possible for
each message to have its own retry interval. This could be useful if you send 
both transactional as well as commercial mass mailings. For transactional 
emails you normally want small intervals because these mails should be 
delivered as soon as possible.

If the "retries" property is not set in the input JSON, MailerQ falls back
to the setting from the config file. The config file variable "retry-interval"
is used for that. This setting should hold a comma separated list of the
delays between the attempts. This should be set to a number of seconds.

The default value is "600,600,1800,1800,3600,3600,7200". This means that the
second and third attempt is sent 10 minutes after the previous attempt. The
next two attemps use an interval of half an hour, then an interval of one
hour for the next two attempts, and all subsequent attempts are sent after
three hour intervals. You can change variable to anything you want.
  

## Server ID

Each message that is accepted by MailerQ gets a unique message ID. To
prevent that two running MailerQ instances both assign exactly the same
ID to a message, you can assign a "server-id" variable. This identifier
guarantees that message ID's will never conflict.

````
server-id:      1
````

## License

To work properly, MailerQ needs a license file. The license file can be 
[downloaded](http://mailerq.com/product/license "MailerQ license") from the 
MailerQ website. You can store the file anywhere on the file system. The path to 
the license file can be configured by setting 

````
license:        <Path to your license> (empty by default)
````

## User

If you have configured MailerQ to use ports lower than 1024 (like port 25 for 
SMTP and/or port 80 for the management console), the MTA must be started as user 
"root". Once the ports have been opened, MailerQ changes its identity to the user 
set in the config file.

````
user:           <user name> (empty by default)
````

The user name to change identify to after the SMTP and HTTP ports have been opened.


## Lockfile

To prevent that MailerQ starts more than once, MailerQ stores its process ID 
(pid) in a lockfile. The name and location of the lockfile can be set in the 
configuration file.

````
lock: <filename>            (default: /tmp/mailerq.pid)
````

## User Statistics

MailerQ sends a hourly message to Copernica. This message contains some use statistics
for that hour, e.g. the number of errors that occured. This information is used
to improve MailerQ. Users with a paid license can disable this message by adding
the heartbeat-enabled property to the config file:

````
heartbeat-enabled:      false    (default: true)
````
