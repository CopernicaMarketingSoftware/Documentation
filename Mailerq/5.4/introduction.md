# Getting started with MailerQ 5.4

MailerQ runs on Linux. To get MailerQ up and running on your own computer or on a server you
need to take a couple of simple steps:

* Download and install MailerQ
* Download and install RabbitMQ
* Fetch a license file (trial or commercial)

To make this very simple, we have made
[a quick start to download and install MailerQ](../../download).

MailerQ comes with a web based [management console](management-console)
that you can use to monitor exactly what is happening, and to adjust all
your delivery settings.
