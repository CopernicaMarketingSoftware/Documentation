# Mail Transfer Agent Management Console

MailerQ comes equipped with a full MTA management console. The management
console allows you to monitor the performance of your email delivery in 
real-time. If necessary, the management console can be used to change 
settings to maximize deliverability on the fly. If you have multiple 
instances of MailerQ running in a cluster, you can easily switch between 
them.
