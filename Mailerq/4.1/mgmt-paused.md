# Management Console: Paused Deliveries

The Paused Deliveries view shows you exactly what email deliveries are currently 
paused. It shows which MTA is paused to which remote IP/domain and until 
when the delivery is paused, and allows you to resume them.  You can
manually pause email deliveries if necessary.  Manually paused MTAs are shown 
here as well.


# Management Console: Redirected deliveries

Email delivery can also be redirected from one IP to another IP. As an 
example: when one of your IPs is greylisted by a receiving domain, this view 
allows you to temporarily redirect from the greylisted IP address to a new one. 
The redirected delivery shows all redirecting rules and which delivery is 
currently being redirected. You can also manually set up redirections.
