# MailerQ examples

MailerQ is compatible with a lot of languages. For a language to be compatible with the MTA, all that is needed is support for JSON and the language being able to communicate with RabbitMQ. Some of the languages where this is possible are: C#, Erlang, Java, .NET, Perl, PHP, Python, Phyton-Puka and Ruby.

For the examples below, it is asumed that MailerQ will be able to communicate with the [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com/) and [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) servers.
