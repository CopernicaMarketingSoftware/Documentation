# Function MQ_SmtpAuthenticated

Returns whether the connection is considered authenticated. If this is the first plugin checking a connection (or if there is only one plugin) this function will initially always return false. If a previous plugin has already set the connection to be authenticated using [MQ_SetSmtpAuthenticated()](copernica-docs:Mailerq/mq_setsmtpauthenticated) this function will return the last value set with this function.
