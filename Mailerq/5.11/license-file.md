# License file

To run MailerQ, you need a valid license file. You can get
free trial license files and commercial license files from the MailerQ website.

If you already have a license, but want to install a newer version of MailerQ,
you need a new license file. This new license file can also be retrieved for free
via the above hyperlink.


## License file location

It is best to store your license file as "etc/mailerq/license.txt". If you
store it in a different location, you have to update your config file.


## Questions or remarks?
