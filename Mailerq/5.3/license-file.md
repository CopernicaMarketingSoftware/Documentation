# License file

To run MailerQ, you need a valid license file. This file contains the list
of IP addresses and/or domains from which you are going to send out mail, plus
the additional MailerQ features that you want to be enabled. You can get
free trial license files and commercial license files from the MailerQ website.

If you already have a license, but want to install a newer version of MailerQ,
you need a new license file. This new license file can also be retrieved for free
via the above hyperlink.


## License file location

It is best to store your license file as "etc/mailerq/license.txt". If you
store it in a different location, you have to update your config file.
