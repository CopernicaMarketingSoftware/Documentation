# Sending bounces with MailerQ

MailerQ can also be used for sending bounces - or, to be more precise:
to send Delivery Status Notifications (DSN).

A Delivery Status Notification is an email message that contains meta
information about the delivery of an email. Mail servers send such DSN
messages to each other when the delivery of an email is delayed, or
when the delivery has completely failed. It is even possible to send
DNS messages on successful delivery, although in practice only
failure and delay notifications are sent.


## Enable DSN messages

Normally, MailerQ does not send DSN messages. All results are published
in JSON format to the appropriate result queues, where you can pick them
up and process them. Most users find it more convenient to collect
results in JSON format from a message queue than setting up a special 
incoming mail server to receive and parse incoming bounces.

However, if you do want to receive bounces by mail, you simply have to
add an extra property to the JSON input that instructs MailerQ that it
should send back a bounce message when something goes wrong:

```json
{
    "envelope":     "example@domain.com",
    "recipient":    "friend@example.com",
    "mime":         "MIME-Version: 1.0\r\n....",
    "dsn":          {
        "envelope":     "mailer-daemon@example.com",
        "notify":       "FAILURE",
        "orcpt":        "example@example.com"
        "ret":          "FULL",
        "envid":        "your-specific-identifier"
    }
}
```

The above message contains a simple straightforward email message that
is sent from envelope address example@domain.com to recipient address
friend@example.com, and the full message content is stored in the "mime"
property. Nothing special to see here.

However, the extra "dsn" property instructs MailerQ (and the mail server
to which the email is going to be delivered as well) to send back a 
DSN message to the envelope address when the mail could not be delivered.
The "dsn" object can have the following five sub properties:

* envelope
* notify
* orcpt
* ret
* envid

The `envelope` property is an optional property that sets the envelope
address that is used by MailerQ when the bounce is sent. You would
normally set this to an address like "mailer-daemon@yourdomain.com".

The `notify` variable specifies what sort of events trigger the delivery
of DSN messages. Possible values are "NEVER", "SUCCESS", "FAILURE" and 
"DELAY". It is also allowed to set this to a comma seperated list of 
values (for example "SUCCESS,FAILURE"). Currently, MailerQ only sends
notifications for failures and successful deliveries, and not yet for
delayed deliveriers. However, if you do set this to "DELAY" and the 
message gets forwarded to an other server, this other server may still
send delay notifications. In other words: even although MailerQ does not
yet send delay notifications, that does not mean that you will never 
receive such notifications.

The property `orcpt` holds the original recipient address. Inside the
bounce message generated by MailerQ, this original recipient address is 
included in the delivery report, and it contains exactly the same
address as set in the `orcpt` JSON property. This property is optional;
if you leave it out the actual `recipient` property will be used.

The bounce message that is sent back by MailerQ holds a full delivery
report, as well as the full original message. If you want to save a lot
of network bandwidth, you can set the `ret` property to the value `HDRS`.
By doing so, you instruct MailerQ not to include the full MIME message
in the status notification, but only the original MIME headers.

The last property that you can include in the "dsn" object, is `envid`.
This is a application specific environment ID, and you can set it to
whatever you like. It will be included in the sent bounce message, so
that you can match the bounces with the sent messages.



## Enable DSN via SMTP

If you inject your mails into MailerQ via SMTP, instead of publishing 
JSON formatted message to the RabbitMQ outbox queue, you can also 
instruct MailerQ to send bounces.

MailerQ supports the DSN extension for the SMTP protocol, and you can
also supply the "notify", "orcpt", "ret" and "envid" variables via
the SMTP protocol:

```smtp

@todo show SMTP communication

```

## Sending a Delivery Status Notification by hand

We start with a lame example. In the end, a delivery status notification
is nothing more than a regular MIME formatted email message,  with a 
different content-type. Because you can use MailerQ to send all sorts of
MIME messages, you can also use it for sending DSN messages. You just 
have to pass in an alternative MIME message:

```json
{
    "envelope":     "mailer-daemon@example.com",
    "recipient":    "example@example.com",
    "mime":         "Content-Type: multipart/report\r\n...."
}
```

Above you see the JSON for sending a DSN message. This is not much
different than sending a regular email, with HTML and/or text content.
The notification will be sent from envelope address 
"mailer-daemon@example.com" and to recipient "example@example.com".


## Tell MailerQ to construct DSN messages

You can also instruct MailerQ to create the DSN messages given a regular
email. You can add one extra property to the input JSON, and MailerQ
will send a completely different type of e-mail. Consider the following
input JSON:

```json
{
    "envelope":     "sender@yourdomain.com",
    "recipient":    "receiver@example.com",
    "mime":         "..."
}
```

The above JSON contains the input for sending a regular email to
"receiver@example.com". Imagine however, that you want to send a 
notification back to the original envelope, containing a report about
exactly this original e-mail. You can achieve this by simply adding a 
"report" property to this JSON object. MailerQ will then convert the
mime data into a DSN that is going to be sent back to the 

```json
{
    "envelope":     "sender@yourdomain.com",
    "recipient":    "receiver@example.com",
    "mime":         "....",
    "dsn": {
        "envelope":     "mailer-daemon@example.com",
        "notify":       "FAILURE,DELAY",                /* supported FAILURE, DELAY, SUCCESS and NEVER */
        "orcpt":        "example@example.com",
        "ret":          "FULL",                         /* HDRS of FULL */
        "envid":        "skldfjslfkjsdlk"
    },
    "report":   {
        "original-envelope-id": "....",     envid uit DSN JSON
        "reporting-mta":        "....",     MailerQ (niet configurabel)
        "received-from-mta":    "....",     niet gezet door MailerQ
        "arrival-date":         "....",     niet gezet door MailerQ
        "human-readable":       "....",     niet gezet door MailerQ
        "full":                 boolean,    True als ret=FULL in input JSON
        "recipients": [ {
            "original":             "....",     orcpt in input JSON
            "final":                "....",     gezet op de recipient
            "action":               "....",     "relayed" of "failed" ("delayed" is nog niet geimplementeerd)
            "status":               "....",     "5.2.1" (code geretourneerd door ontvanger)
            "remote-mta":           "....",     niet gezet door MailerQ
            "diagnostic-code":      "....",     de SMTP code
            "last-attempt-date":    "....",     de tijd waarop de laatste poging voor het bericht was ingeroosterd
            "final-log-id":         "....",     niet gebruikt door MailerQ
            "will-retry-until":     "...."      niet gebruikt door MailerQ
        } ]
    }
}
```

When MailerQ detects that the "report" propery was added to the JSON
input, it suddenly








It is
therefore very easy to send DSN messages with MailerQ: just insert the
