<h1>PHP example</h1>
<p>
    This example assumes that MailerQ is running and configured and
    that PHP is working on the server with the
    <a href="http://pecl.php.net/package/amqp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PECL AMQP package</a>
    installed.
</p>
<p>
    The PHP example consists of three files; settings.php, send.php and
    result.php. If you want to use these scripts, save the three files
    inside the same folder.
</p>
<h3>settings.php</h3>
<p>
    The settings.php file, defines the settings that are needed to
    connect to RabbitMQ and it also contains the settings that are
    being used for sending an email. If you want to use the PHP
    example to test your MailerQ configuration, you will have to
    adjust the values inside the settings.php file to match your
    configuration of MailerQ.
</p>
<p>
 
<pre class="language-php"><code>

&lt;?php
/**
 *  This file holds the settings that the PHP test script uses to connect
 *  to RabbitMQ and to construct the message that will be placed on the
 *  outbox message queue.
 */

// RabbitMQ configuration options, replace those values with your own
// values, those values have to correspond with the values in the MailerQ
// config.txt file
$hostname  = 'localhost';    // same as the rabbitmq-host option in the config file
$username  = 'guest';        // same as the rabbitmq-user option in the config file
$password  = 'guest';        // same as the rabbitmq-password option in the config file
$vhost     = '/';            // same as the rabbitmq-vhost option in the config file
$outbox    = 'outbox_test';  // same as the rabbitmq-outbox option in the config file
$resultbox = 'results_test'; // same as the rabbitmq-results option in the config file

// email message settings
$recipientDomain = 'example.org';      // domain where the test message should be delivered
$recipientEmail  = 'info@example.org'; // email where the test message should be delivered
$fromAddress     = 'me@my-domain.com'; // address where the email was sent from

?&gt;
</code></pre>

</p>
<h3>send.php</h3>
<p>
    This php script connects to RabbitMQ and places a JSON encoded 
    message on the outbox message queue. To connect to RabbitMQ and
    to create the JSON encoded message, the script uses the values
    from the settings.php file. If you want to use this script to
    test your MailerQ configuration, you will have to run the send.php
    script before running the result.php script.

<h3>result.php</h3>
<p>
    This php script connects to the RabbitMQ server and gets the message,
    that was placed on the outbox message queue by the send.php script,
    back from the result message queue. The result message from the
    result queue is shown to the user. The result.php can only output
    any relevant information, if it is executed after the send.php
    script was executed.
