# Property name

The property `name` can be used to identify the template. This is a meta property, 
and therefore does not have any effect on either the headers or the contents of 
the email. This property can be useful if you want to give a name to your 
template to easily identify it.

There are no restrictions to the name, and the name does not even have to
be unique (although it probably is a good idea to use unique names for your
templates). This is an optional property.

## Example

The following input JSON contains a very simple example template the top two 
properties are its `name` and `description`. Both the [`name`](../json/property-name) 
and [`description`](../json/property-description) 
properties are meta properties that are not used by the API to generate the 
email, but that may be helpful to identify and/or describe the template.

```javascript
{
  "name": "Name of the template",
  "description": "Description of the template",
  "from": "info@example.com",
  "subject": "Example email",
  "background": {
    "color": "#f3f3f3"
    },
    "content": {
      "blocks": [
            {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "This is an example email"
            }, {
              "type": "image",
              "src": "http://www.example.com/logo.gif"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

The property [`name`](../json/property-name) can 
be used to give the template a name. Both the [`name`](../json/property-name) 
and the [`description`](../json/property-description) 
are [top level properties](../json/top-level-properties).
