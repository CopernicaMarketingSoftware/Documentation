# Tracking property `force`

If you include the [`pixel`](json/property-pixel)
property to add a tracking pixel to your responsive email, you may find
yourself in a position that the pixel was left out of your email after all!

This happens if your email holds other images as well. The ResponsiveEmail.com 
service assumes that you add tracking variables to all the images in your email, 
and that the tracking pixel is only necessary if your email does not contain any 
images at all. If you want to turn off this behavior, and want to include the 
tracking pixel _no matter_ the number of other images in the mail, you can use 
the `force` property.

```javascript
{
    "name" : "template13",
    "subject" : "This email is being tracked by the NSA",
    "from" : "info@example.com",
    "tracking" : {
        "pixel" : "http://www.prism.gov/images/pixel.gif",
        "force" : true
    }
}
```
