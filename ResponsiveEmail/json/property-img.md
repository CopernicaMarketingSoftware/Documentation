# Property `img`

The `img` property is a very advanced property inside 
[image blocks](ResponsiveEmail/json/block-image) that gives you
direct access to the HTML `<img>` tag. If you want to set custom CSS properties 
or if you want to add attributes to the `<img>` tag that are not supported by 
the responsive API, you can use the nested `img` property for it.

Inside the `img` property you can use the [`css`](ResponsiveEmail/json/property-css) 
and [`attributes`](ResponsiveEmail/json/property-attributes) 
sub properties to change the `<img>` tag. Please keep in mind that the `img` 
property is a very advanced property, and that you normally do not have to make 
any changes to the `<img>` tag that is generated by the responsive API. In 
a normal input JSON document, you will therefore not see the `img` property.
