# Property `columns`

The property `columns` accepts a JSON array, with a comma seperated list with 
JSON objects, containing the actual `blocks` inside the `columns`.

```javascript
{
    "from" : "info@example.com",
    "subject" : "Email with a single link",
    "content" : {
        "blocks" : [ {
            "type": "columns",
            "columns" : [ {
                "size" : 6,
                "blocks" : [
                    {
                        "type" : "text",
                        "content" : "I'm just a text block within a column."
                    }
                ]
            }, {
                "size" : 6,
                "blocks" : [
                    {
                        "type" : "text",
                        "content" : "I'm another text block within a column, I'm next to the other text block."
                    }
                ]
            } ]
        } ]
    }
}
```

The `columns` property has 2 mandatory properties: `size` and `blocks`. Because
the API is based on  [ZURB's INK boilerplate](http://zurb.com/ink/docs.php "visit docs of the email boilerplate template"), 
which is a 12 column grid system, each row in your email, can contain up to 12 blocks.
