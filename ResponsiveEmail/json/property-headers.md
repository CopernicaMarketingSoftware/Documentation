# Property `headers`

The ResponsiveEmail API supports many predefined properties to set MIME headers. 
These include properties like [`subject`](ResponsiveEmail/json/property-subject), 
[`to`](ResponsiveEmail/json/property-to) and [`reply-to`](ResponsiveEmail/json/property-reply-to). 
But if you want to set other headers in the header too, maybe even unofficial 
headers, you can do so by using the `headers` property.

## Example

To add a single '`x-my-header`' to the MIME of your responsive email, you may 
include a `headers` property in the input JSON.

```javascript
{
    "from"    : "info@example.com",
    "subject" : "This is the subject line",
    "headers" : {
        "x-my-header" : "my-value"
    }
}
```

All the headers are directly copied from the input JSON into the responsive
email, without any validation.

## Warning!

If you use your own headers, we strongly advise to prefix your headers with `x-`, 
as we have shown in the example above. Prefixing with `x-` is the official way 
to prevent that your custom headers conflict with current or future official 
email headers.

## Related information

The `headers` property should be used for setting custom headers. For the normal 
headers, better use one of the predefined properties, like [`subject`](ResponsiveEmail/json/property-subject), 
[`from`](ResponsiveEmail/json/property-from), 
[`replyTo`](ResponsiveEmail/json/property-reply-to), 
[`to`](ResponsiveEmail/json/property-to), 
[`cc`](ResponsiveEmail/json/property-cc) 
and [`bcc`](ResponsiveEmail/json/property-bcc).
