# Button block

The button block allows you to add buttons, optimized for HTML email, to your 
email document. But unlike what you would expect, an email button is not turned 
into a HTML `<button>` tag, but built using a HTML `<table>` by the Responsive 
Email API, because it renders better on different email clients.
