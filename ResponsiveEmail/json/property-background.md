# Property `background`

The property `background` lets you set background related properties, and can be 
used at many different levels inside the input JSON to set, for example, 
the background for a single block of content, for an column full of content or 
for the entire template.

## Sub properties

The `background` property accepts a nested JSON object as value. Inside this 
block you can use sub properties to set more specific properties. At this 
specific moment however, only the sub property `color` can be used.

## Background properties

| Property | Value | Description          |
|:---------|-------|----------------------|
| color | _string_ | The background color |

Colors may be specified as an RGB triplet or in hexadecimal format. They may 
also be specified according to their common English names (e.g., 'red', 
'PaleGoldenrod').

## Where to use?

The `background` property can be used at almost every level in the input JSON. 
If you use it as a [top level property](../json/top-level-properties), 
its value will be used as the background for the entire template. Inside the 
[content section](../json/property-content) it holds 
the background of the centered content, and inside a block you can use it to set 
the background color for just a single block.

## Example

Here is an example with the background property used in many different places.

```javascript
{
    "from" : "info@example.com",
    "subject" : "Email with many different background colors",
    "background" : {
        "color" : "gray"
    },
    "content" : {
        "background" : {
            "color" : "yellow"
        },
        "blocks" : [ {
            "type" : "text",
            "content" : "This is a the opening paragraph of text"
        }, {
            "type" : "button",
            "label" : "Click me!",
            "background" : {
                "color" : "white"
            }
        }, {
            "type" : "text",
            "content" : "This is the closing paragraph of text"
        } ]
    }
}
```

The above input JSON will result in an email with a gray background. Inside that 
email, there is a centered content section with a yellow background. Inside that 
content section a button is displayed with a piece of text above it, and a piece 
of text below it. The button will be displayed on a white background, while no 
specific background is set for both the texts, which implies that the texts are 
shown on the same yellow background used for the entire content section.
