# Property `container` 

All blocks, whether they are text blocks, image blocks or blocks of any of the 
other supported types, are wrapped by the responsive API in table `<td>` elements. 
In normal circumstances, you do not have to make any changes to such a `<td>` 
element, but if you insist, the responsive API allows you to access this element 
via the `container` property.

The `container` property is an advanced nested property inside each block, and can be
used to change the styling or even the attributes of the `<td>`. The `container` 
property accepts a JSON object with optional nested
[`css`](copernica-docs:ResponsiveEmail/json/property-css) and [`attributes`](copernica-docs:ResponsiveEmail/json/property-attributes)
sub properties. The `css` and `attributes` in turn also accept JSON blocks containing the 
CSS properties or element attributes you want to add to the container. 

## Container properties

| Property | Value | Description                                                                                                         |
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [css](copernica-docs:ResponsiveEmail/json/property-css) | _object_ | Add custom css to the container element                           |
| [attributes](copernica-docs:ResponsiveEmail/json/property-attributes) | _object_ | Add custom HTML attributes to the container element |

## Example

Every property that you set in the container `css` property will be
appended to the inline `style` attribute of the `<td>` tag. And every `attributes`
property will be set as attribute of the `<td>` tag. Consider the following JSON 
example of a button block:


```javascript
{
    "from" : "info@example.com",
    "subject" : "Example container modification",
    "content" : {
        "blocks" : [ {
            "type" : "button",
            "label" : "Responsive",
            "link" : {
                "url" : "https://responsiveemail.com",
                "title" : "Go to website"
            },
            "container" : {
                "css" : {
                    "padding" : "20em",
                    "margin" : "2px"
                },
                "attributes" : {
                    "summary" : "This summary is applied to the parent"
                }
            }
        } ]
    }
}
```

**This would result in the following pseudo HTML**

(for the sake of readability, we omitted the default button styling in this example)

```html
<td style="padding: 20em; margin: 2px" summary="This summary is applied to the parent">
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Responsive
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</td>
```

## Why are table cells used, and not just divs?

The `container` property allows you to specify custom CSS and attributes for 
the parent element, which always is a `<td>` tag. Of course, we've all learned
to use tables for displaying tabular data, and use `<div>` tags to build the 
lay-out of an HTML design. Not so true with emails! 

When building an email lay-out, you have to deal with all sorts of primitive and 
broken email clients that are not so good at displaying HTML and CSS, and with 
email clients that strip out stylesheets before the email is rendered. Worst of 
them all: Gmail (true fact!). One of the many downsides of this whole thing is 
that having your HTML designs built using divs and floats will make it look like 
a scrambled egg in almost every email client. Especially in Gmail. 

To overcome such problems, email layouts use nested oldschool HTML `<table>` tags, 
just like websites did in the 90's. Blocks are not implemented as `<div>` elements, 
as you would expect, but `<td>` tags. An image block, for example, creates 
an `<img>` tag, and puts that inside a `<td>` cell. And this is what the `container` 
property inside the JSON block input gives you access to. It allows you to access 
and modify the `<td>` tag.

## Why you should avoid using these properties

We discourage the use of the `container` property. We wrote
the responsive email API to put an end to all the internal difficulties of building 
responsive emails. In our opinion, users of the API do not have to deal with 
specific CSS settings, or with the fact that HTML tables are used. With the 
responsive email API you can be sure of the fact that any input JSON is turned 
into a valid responsive email.

The `container` property completely bypasses this fundamental design principle: 
the properties are blindly copied from the JSON into the responsive email without 
any validation. If done wrongly, this could harm your email.
