# Property `blocks`

The property `blocks` is used inside feed blocks to control which blocks are 
created for each article and in which order.

The following blocks can be generated for articles within the feed:

- heading
- image
- html

If the `blocks` property is given, it must be an array with one or more of these 
items. The blocks will be generated in the order in which they appear in the 
`blocks` property. If they are not present the block will not be created.

The following example will completely ignore images within the article and instead 
only show the heading and article content.

```javascript
{
    "from": "info@example.com",
    "subject": "Email with a feed block",
    "content": {
        "blocks": [
            {
                "type": "feed",
                "source": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml",
                "blocks": [
                    "heading",
                    "html"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
