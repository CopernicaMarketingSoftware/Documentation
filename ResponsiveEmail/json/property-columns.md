# Property `columns`

The property `columns` is a nested property that is used inside a 
[columns block](copernica-docs:ResponsiveEmail/json/block-columns). It expects
a JSON array as value, with a list of JSON objects. Each object in this array 
describes the contents of a single column.

```javascript
    {
        "from" : "info@example.com",
        "subject" : "Email with two text blocks side by side",
        "content" : {
            "blocks" : [ {
                "type" : "columns",
                "columns" : [ {
                    "size" : 6,
                    "blocks" : [
                        {
                            "type" : "text",
                            "content" : "I'm just a text block within a column."
                        }
                    ]
                }, {
                    "size" : 6,
                    "blocks" : [
                        {
                            "type" : "text",
                            "content" : "I'm another text block within a column, I'm next to the other text block."
                        }
                    ]
                } ]
            } ]
        }
    }
```

The above example holds an email with a single block. This block happens to be a 
`columns` block, that splits the mail in two columns. Each column contains a single 
text block.

## Supported properties

The `columns` property itself holds an array of JSON objects, with every object 
representing a single column. The following table shows the nested properties 
that can be set for each column.

### Columns [ { ... }, { ... } ] properties

| Property | Value | Desc.                                                                                                                                                         |
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [blocks](copernica-docs:ResponsiveEmail/json/property-blocks) | _array_ | An array with objects, each one representing any other block type, such as `button` and `text` blocks. |
| [size](copernica-docs:ResponsiveEmail/json/property-size) | _integer_ | The size of the column. Supported values are 1 up to 12.                                                 |
| [container](copernica-docs:ResponsiveEmail/json/property-container) | _object_ | Get access to the container element                                                             |
| [background](copernica-docs:ResponsiveEmail/json/property-background) | _object_ | The background of the column.                                                                 |

The most important property is the [`blocks`](copernica-docs:ResponsiveEmail/json/property-blocks)
property. You can use it to assign an array of other blocks that are placed inside 
the column. To keep the examples readable, we normally show this property with 
only a single block in it (in the example on this page, we show it twice with 
a single text block), but nothing forbids you from using it for much longer arrays.

The other important property is the `size` property. All the columns together
are placed in a twelve columns wide fluid grid. You can assign each column a size 
from 1 to 12, as long as the total of all sizes is 12. Thus, if you want to 
create a mail with two small side columns, and a wider column in the middle, you 
could use column sizes 2-8-2.

```javascript
{
    "from" : "info@example.com",
    "subject" : "Email with two small columns on the side",
    "content" : {
        "blocks" : [ {
            "type" : "columns",
            "columns" : [ {
                "size" : 2,
                "blocks" : [
                
                    /* array of small blocks in the left column */
                
                ]
            }, {
                "size" : 8,
                "blocks" : [
                
                    /* array of wide blocks in the center column */
                ]
            }, {
                "size" : 2,
                "blocks" : [
                
                    /* array of small blocks in the right column */
                ]
            } ]
        }, {
            "type" : "text",
            "source" : "text that spans all three columns"
        } ]
    }
}
```
