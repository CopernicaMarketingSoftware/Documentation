# Property `a`

The `a` property is a very advanced property inside [link blocks](ResponsiveEmail/json/block-link), 
[button blocks](ResponsiveEmail/json/block-button) 
and [image blocks](ResponsiveEmail/json/block-image) that gives you
direct access to the HTML `<a>` tag. If you want to set custom CSS properties or 
if you want to add attributes to the `<a>` tag that are not supported by the 
responsive API, you can use the `a` property for it.

Inside the `a` property you can use the [css](ResponsiveEmail/json/property-css) 
and [`attributes`](ResponsiveEmail/json/property-attributes) sub 
properties to change the `<a>` tag. Please keep in mind that the `a` property is 
a very advanced property, and that you normally do not have to make any changes 
to the `<a>` tag that is generated by the responsive API. In a normal input JSON 
document, you will therefore not see the `a` property.
