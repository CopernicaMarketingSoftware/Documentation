# API method GET /v1/template/{ID}/text

After storing a template on the ResponsiveEmail.com servers, you can retrieve 
the plain text representation using this method. This will simply return the 
[text property](ResponsiveEmail/json/property-text).

## Example request

```http
GET /v1/template/2345/text?access_token=yourtoken
Host: www.responsiveemail.com

HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
Date: Mon, 03 Nov 2014 16:46:59 GMT
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 38

This is the text version of the email.
```

## Personalization

In order to [personalize](ResponsiveEmail/personalization) the output it's possible to
provide additional key-value pairs containing personalization data as parameters to the GET request.
Without these parameters an unpersonalized output will be returned.

## Related information

You can only retrieve the text version of templates that you created earlier 
with a POST call to the [/v1/template](ResponsiveEmail/api/post-template) method.
