# API method GET /v1/template/{ID}/webversion

After you've stored a template on the `responsiveemail.com` servers, you can retrieve the
web version representation of it. The input JSON is converted into HTML code that you
can host on a web server.

## Example request

```http
GET /v1/template/2345/web?access_token=yourtoken
Host: www.responsiveemail.com

HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
Date: Mon, 03 Nov 2014 16:46:59 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 239872

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head> ....
```

To help readability, we have left out most of the returned HTML code in
above example.

## Personalization

In order to [personalize](personalization) the output it's possible to
provide additional key-value pairs containing personalization data as parameters
to the GET request. Without these parameters an unpersonalized output will be returned.

## Related information

Note that the returned HTML code is optimized for *web browsers*. If the template 
JSON contains [visibility properties](../json/property-visibility) 
that limit certain blocks to only be visible in an email, then these blocks will 
not be included in the returned HTML code. If you want to fetch the HTML version 
of an email optimized to use in email messages, use the [/v1/template/{ID}/html](../api/get-template-html) 
method instead.
