# API method POST /v1/mime

With this method you can convert JSON directly into a MIME representation of an
email, without storing any data on the responsiveemail.com servers.

## Example request

```http
POST /v1/mime?access_token=yourtoken
Host: www.responsiveemail.com
Content-Type: application/json

{ "name" : "template..." }

HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
Date: Mon, 03 Nov 2014 16:46:59 GMT
Content-Type: multipart/mixed
Content-Length: 239872

Content-Type: text/html; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
Mime-Version: 1.0
Subject: Responsive email.com example
From: Clayton <clayton@copernica.com>

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN http://www.w3.org/T=
R/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">=0A<html xmlns=3D"http://www.w3.org/1999/xh=
tml"><head><meta http-equiv=3D"content-type" content=3D"text/html; charset=
```

To help readability, we have left out most of the returned MIME code in
above example. Also note that the HTTP protocol also returns data
in MIME format, so although it looks like you receive two headers, the
first header is the HTTP header and the second header is part of the returned email.

## Use personalization data

If your template uses [personalization](../json/personalization) data, you
can get a MIME for certain data by passing this data as a JSON object in
the `data` property of your JSON.
