# Introduction

The responsiveEmail API allows you to create and send responsive emails using 
a simple to use API. 

## How does it work?

If you want to create or send a responsive email, you send a JSON object to the 
API, containing all information about the email. The API will take care of 
generating the HTML code that works on all browsers and all email clients.

The documentation for the API has been split up into two different parts: the 
first part deals with all the different API calls, and the second part 
describes exactly what JSON properties are supported.
