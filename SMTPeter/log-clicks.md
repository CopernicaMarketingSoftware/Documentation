# Clicks logfiles

Log files with the prefix "clicks" hold information about the clicks that
are generated by your sent messages. You can download the content of these
files in CSV format using the [REST logfiles API](rest-logfiles). These
log files contain the following data in the respective order: 

| Data                | Description                                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MessageID           | The id of the message that generated the click                      |
| Time stamp          | The time of the click in the form YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss               |
| The server headers  | The headers that where used to make the call, separated by newlines |
| The IP adress       | The IP address of the system where the link was clicked             |
| The message URL     | The URL in the message that was clicked                             |
| The destination URL | The URL to which the clicker was directed to                        |

Some fields in the returned CSV file contain newlines, so a script that
processes the CSV file needs to be a little smarter than just look for
the next newlines to find the next record.
