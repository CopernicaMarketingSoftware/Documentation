# Email archiving

All emails that you send through SMTPeter are archived. If you ever
want to look back at the mails that you sent, you can use the dashboard
or the REST API to fetch the original headers, text or HTML version
of sent email messages.

Internally, SMTPeter uses smart algorithms to recognize emails that
are (almost) similar, so that only the differences between emails
get logged. Via the SMTPeter dashboard you can see how much data is
taken up by your account, and you can throw away data if you no longer
need it.
