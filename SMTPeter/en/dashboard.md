# Dashboard

![Dashboad overview](Images/dashboardoverview.png)

SMTPeter gives you all the possibilities needed to get an overview
of statisitics behind the emails you've sent. This can be done
inside the SMTPeter dashboard environment.


## Statistics

The SMTPeter dashboard directly shows you what statistics have been
acquired over the last period. You can track down the number of clicks,
opens, sent emails and bounces. It's possible to zoom in on the graph.
You do this by clicking on the desired starting point, holding it
and then drag the mouse towards the desired endpoint.


## Sender Reputation

In the menu on the left side, you see the tab containing `sender reputation`.
This is the place where you can check to see how your reputation as a sender is
valued. This reputation is built by the status of the *DMARC Analyzer* and the 
*Blacklist Tool*. By clicking on one of these two options, you can find out
what is going well or the exact contrary.


## Operations log

The `operations log` tab shows you the log files which you can retrieve through the 
API. These log files consist of the familiar calls: attempts, fails, opens and 
bounces. SMTPeter displays all the results in a well-arranged manner, so that
you can notice patterns quickly and move on.
