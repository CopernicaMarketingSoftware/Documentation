# Sender domains

SMTPeter uses the concept of "Sender Domains" to simplify email. 
At all services that Copernica offers, it is **mandatory** to use
sender domains. This allows you to send your email through our servers 
without having to worry about complicated things like SPF, DKIM and DMARC. 
You focus on your business, while we take care of your messages.

But what exactly do we mean with a sender domain? It works pretty neat: 
you open the SMTPeter dashboard to specify from which domains you intend 
to send email, and we tell you how you should configure your DNS. The
"sender domain" is the domain name that you are going to use for your
mails.

For example, if you want to send out emails using addresses that end with 
"@yourdomain.com" or with "@yourotherdomain.org", you simply use the dashboard 
to set up two sender domains: "yourdomain.com" and "yourotherdomain.org". After 
you've set up these sender domains, SMTPeter gives you a list of recommended 
DNS records. You copy these records to your DNS server (or give them to your 
DNS provider) and that's basically all there is to it: after you've followed 
our recommendations you can use SMTPeter to send email.

## A little more details

Lets be honest here. Sending email is getting more and more complicated. 
There are a lot of things to care about: you have to set up SPF records in 
your DNS in which you list all IP addresses from which you send out email, 
you need rotating public/private key pairs for DKIM signatures, and you 
also want to set up DMARC records in your DNS so that the world knows that 
you are the only one who uses your domain to send mail.

With "sender domains" SMTPeter takes all these responsibilities out of your 
hands. We create your SPF, DKIM and DMARC records and store them 
on _our_ DNS servers. All that you have to do is create a couple of records 
in _your_ DNS record (or ask/instruct your DNS provider to do so) pointing  
to our records. If we make a change to the DNS (for example, because we rotate 
one of your private DKIM keys), it gets automatically propagated over the 
internet, because your DNS records just point to our records.

In our DNS (using *.smtpeter.com subdomains) we set up the following records:

- [SPF records](spf-validation) that list all IP addresses from which you send email
- [DKIM keys](dkim-signing) with your public keys that we rotate once a month
- [DMARC records](dmarc-deployment) with your DMARC policies

We ask you to set up CNAME records and other aliases in your DNS to refer
to these records. 

## The "from" address

For each sender domain we host the public DKIM keys in our DNS. We also
have a copy of the private key on our servers so that we can add a DKIM 
signature to each mail that flows through the SMTPeter servers.

To decide which keys to use, we extract the "from" address from all
emails that we process. That's why it is important that you always use
the same domain names in the from addresses of your emails. Only the 
emails for which you've set up a sender domain can be signed.

## The tracking and bounce domains

If you set up a sender domain you are asked to configure your tracking and
bounce domains. These are the hostnames that we use to track clicks,
opens and errors. The suggested defaults, "clicks.example.com" and 
"bounce.example.com" are sufficient for most users. 

Please be aware, however, that if you configure SMTPeter to track clicks all hyperlinks 
in your emails are going to be rewritten to use the click domain. The default
"clicks.yourdomain.com" might look like a tracking domain to your users (which 
is not that strange, given the fact that it actually _is_ a tracking domain).
If you rather have URLs that look more neutral (for example "specialoffers.example.com",
or "www.example.com") you can change the click domain in the
sender domain configuration.

The same applies to the bounce domain, although the bounce domain is less 
visible for the receivers of your email. It is only used for the envelope
domain, which is normally not shown to users, unless they inspect the original email source.
