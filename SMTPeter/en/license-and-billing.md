# License and billing information

This page describes how you can get a license for SMTPeter, what the price
structure is and how the billing works.

## License

You need to have a license before you can use SMTPeter. You can create a license
by logging in on [SMTPeter](https://www.smtpeter.com/app/) with your with
your Copernica account credentials. If you do not have a Copernica account
yet, you can create one over [here](https://www.smtpeter.com/app/#/menu/register).


## Payment structure

You pay a small amount per month to use SMTPeter. This amount includes a 
certain amount of emails that can be sent for free (see our [pricing page](https://www.smtpeter.com/pricing)
for the exact details). If you want to send more emails, you simply can
increase your payment. You can send emails as long as your balance is high enough to 
support the amount of emails you want to send (e.g. if your balance allows for
100.000 emails and you want to send 100.001 emails, you will have to increase
your balance). You only pay for the amount of emails that you have sent in
a month. So, if you happen to have sent less emails in a month, your credit will be
passed to the next month. The price per sent email decreases with the amount
of sent emails. This discount will be calculated automatically. For the exact
prices you can visit our [pricing page](https://www.smtpeter.com/pricing)

## Billing

All billing is done automatically, and at the end of each month you will receive
a receipt/invoice about your costs for the past month. 

## Other payment options

If you prefer to use a postpay option instead of the pay-as-you-go payment, you
can contact us at [info@smtpeter.com](mailto:info@smtpeter.com "email us") or
call at +31 (0)20 520 61 90. 

The post payment method means you will be invoiced
for the amount of emails you have sent at the end of each month. Of course the same
discounts as in the pay-as-you go payment system apply for the post payment system. 
This invoice has to be paid within two weeks of the invoice date.
