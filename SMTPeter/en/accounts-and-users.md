# Accounts and users

The user management module is the place where you can edit your own
information, such as company name or credentials, and also create new logins for colleagues. 
This is also where access rights to accounts can be managed. We distinguish 
between 'users', 'accounts' and 'companies'. This may seem complicated, but 
each has a purpose. We will explain them more in-depth now.

## Accounts and companies

Most of the time an SMTPeter account is used by one company. In this case 
your 'company' is equal to your company name. However, the SMTPeter company 
with the license might send email for multiple companies. In this case it 
is useful to create an account for each company the licensed company sends 
email for. To each account you can add users that are allowed to access 
it. There are different permissions. If you send email for different companies 
you can add users with viewing permission, such that the companies can monitor 
the email you sent for them.

It's also possible for companies that send their own email to add a user, 
for example to give an external specialist access to the software and data. 
The triangle below illustrates the relation between 'company', 'account' 
and 'user'.

The triangular relationship as pictured above makes it possible to grant 
different sorts of access to accounts. In the user dashboard you can 
create these types of relations to your liking, depending on your
access rights.

## How does this work in practice?

The SMTPeter application has an account management section where you can 
manage users, accounts and company information.  If you're a regular user, 
i.e. a single account with a few colleagues, this may look a little superfluous:
you have a list of colleagues and a list of people with access to the account, 
while these are often the same list.

As described, this is because of the triangular structure, which you can use in the case of multiple
accounts, or if you want to grant access to a non-colleague.
