# Other REST calls

The REST API offers, besides the many send options, many other options.
SMTPeter keeps track of all processes that are going on and registers everything
that passes the servers. Now, you can retrieve data from the past with the various
calls. You can retrieve the following categories: 'events', 'log files', 'DMARC reports'
and 'templates'. In short, with the REST API you have all information and options at your disposal.
