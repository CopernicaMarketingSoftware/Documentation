## Getting started: SMTP API

Instead of the REST API, the traditional SMTP API can also be used to connect with SMTPeter. This API is 
best used when connecting to traditional email clients such as Outlook and Thunderbird, and when connecting 
with mobile devices. 

In order to use the SMTP API, you must create a valid username and password in the application. Remember 
these well, because you will only see them once! Subsequently you can send mails via SMTP to SMTPeter.
The SMTP settings that you will need can be found [here](smtp-ports). You can also read the
[general SMTP API documentation](smtp-api) if you want to know more.

If you want to use both APIs that is possible too. That way, you can use the features you like best 
from both.
