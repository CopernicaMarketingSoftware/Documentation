# Sender domain setup

In order to use SMTPeter you have to setup the domain from which you want
to send your emails. We call this domain the *sender domain* and it can 
be configured via the [dashboard](dashboard) in the sender domain module. 
This module can be found under the `Sender Domains` tab in the application. 
The interface speaks for itself: click `Add sender domain` and follow the steps.
Donâ€™t worry about your click- and tracking domains or the DMARC deployment, 
you can always edit them later on. You can consult the article on 
[sender domains](./sender-domains) for more information.
