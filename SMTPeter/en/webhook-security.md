# Security of a webhook

To prevent your confidential information from being intercepted and to protect your sensitive data, you can specify
a https endpoint so that all data will be encrypted. However, security doesn't stop there.

Usually, endpoints are open to the world. This means that anyone with the url has access
to it. To verify that a request is actually generated by SMTPeter and not a third-party that pretends to be someone else, SMTPeter signs the request headers. In this way, users can verify that requests are generated by our services.  

## Headers

### Digest

The `Digest` header is added in accordance to [RFC 3230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3230#section-4.3.2).
This can be used to verify message integrity.

### X-Copernica-ID

An identifier for your SMTPeter environment is added. The header will contain the data in the 
form of `X-Copernica-ID: environment_<number>`. 

### Signature

The headers are signed using a draft for a standard of signing HTTP messages, which you can
find [here](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures-10).

As a `keyId`, an url is provided in which a key can be found in the TXT record. Currently, DKIM is used. 
To improve security, the headers in the signature should at least contain the following fields:
- (request-target)
- Host
- Date
- X-Copernica-ID
- Digest

Verifying all these headers will ensure that the full message is from SMTPeter.

### Example

You can find an example implementation of correct message verification [here](https://github.com/CopernicaMarketingSoftware/webhook-security).
