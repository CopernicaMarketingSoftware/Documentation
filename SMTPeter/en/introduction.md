# Getting started with SMTPeter

SMTPeter is a cloud-based email gateway for fast and secure email 
delivery. All mail that you send through SMTPeter is preprocessed,
archived, signed and gets forwarded to the actual recipient.

By sending your mail through SMTPeter you ensure that all your messages
comply to the latest SPF, DKIM and DMARC rules, and that the delivery
rate of your email stream is optimized for the receiving servers. You 
can also obtain statistics for everything that was sent through
SMTPeter, increase the consistency of the layout of your emails and use
other nice features of SMTPeter.


## Bulk, transactional and personal mail

SMTPeter can be used for all your outgoing mail. Whether you're sending
bulk mailings, transactional mails from out of your website or personal
mails from your own computer or telephone, if you send your messages 
through SMTPeter (instead of to the recipient directly) you improve
your delivery, and enhance your mail. Check our features:

SMTPeter has a [standard SMTP API](./smtp-api), so you can simply configure 
your personal user agent (like Microsoft Outlook, Thunderbird or the email
program on your tablet or telephone) to connect to SMTPeter. 

To connect your website or newsletter to SMTPeter you can use this
[SMTP API](./smtp-api) too, but we have a [REST API](./rest-api) as well, that 
allows you to pass in all kinds of additional parameters and marketing tags.
