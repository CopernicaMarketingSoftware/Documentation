# Setting up SMTPeter in Apple Mail

It is possible to use SMTPeter in combination with Apple's mail client. Follow these steps to add SMTPeter as your outgoing mail server.

Go to 'Accounts' and select the account you want to use with SMTPeter. Click the menu next to 'Outgoing mail server' and select 'Edit SMTP server list' Click the '+'-symbol to add a new server to the list. Fill in the settings:

- 'Description' should hold a name that you pick for the server
- 'Server name' holds 'mail.smtpeter.com'
- 'Port' should hold the number of the port you want to use
- 'Authentication' should be set to 'Password'
- 'User name' and 'Password' should hold the credentials of the SMTP login that you created in SMTPeter
