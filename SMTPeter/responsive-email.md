# Using ResponsiveEmail with SMTPeter

If you want to use SMTPeter for more than email delivery, 
and also want to create, save and edit templates in an 
easy to use interface, the [ResponsiveEmail service](https://www.responsiveemail.com "ResponsiveEmail Website") 
is what you are looking for!

All email you send with ResponsiveEmail are delivered 
using SMTPeter. It also offers a well-documented API, 
for fetching templates and template statistics. 

ResponsiveEmail also offers all delivery features SMTPeter does. 
However, inlining CSS is not nessecary because the editor does this 
automatically. 

## Drag & Drop template editor

ResponsiveEmail has been designed to do exactly as the name implies: 
create responsive emails. In order to make this as easy as possible 
we have built an easy-to-use drag & drop template editor. 

## Use your SMTPeter login details. 

All Coperncia's products can be accessed with the same login credentials. 
So if you already have an SMTPeter account, you can simply use your SMTPeter 
website details to log into ResponsiveEmail.
