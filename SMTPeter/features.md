# SMTPeter features

SMTPeter has several optional features which can be enabled or 
disabled per email message. 

> **Note:** These features are currently being worked on and should be implemented 
soon.

## Inlining CSS

Enabling the inline css feature means all css in the style header of your email
will be placed inline by SMTPeter. This is sometimes nessecary because some ISPs
(e.g. Google) do not support style headers. By placing the CSS inline the style
of your email will be displayed correctly in the inbox of recipients using these
ISPs.

## Bounce Tracking

Enabling the bounce tracking function means all bounces of your email will be tracked
by SMTPeter. These statistics will be shown in the statistics overview of your SMTPeter
dashboard.
