# Personalization

With SMTPeter you can easily personalize your mailings. You simply add some
personal data about the recipient(s) and send this together with your
[message template](programming) to SMTPeter. SMTPeter will rewrite your
template given the data into a personalized mail. A template can be
simple, where only some names have to be filled in, or very complex where
the content is completely personalized based on the age, gender, and the
number of children that one has. It is up to you.
