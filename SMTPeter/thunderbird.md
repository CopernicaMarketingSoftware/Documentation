# Setting up Thunderbird

If you use Mozilla Thunderbird as your email client, and you want to send all 
your outgoing messages through SMTPeter, you can take the following steps
to connect to SMTPeter.

In Thunderbird go to account settings: 

![Account Settings](account_settings.png "Go to account settings")

In your account settings go to the Outgoing Server and press Add. A small 
popup window comes up: 

![Add SMTP server](add_smtp_server.png "Add SMTP server")

Here you have to fill out our SMTP settings and username: 

![SMTP settings](smtp_settings.png "Configure SMTP settings")

Now you have set up SMTPeter as a possible SMTP server, the next step is to 
make sure you use it. You do not have to enter a password yet, you will be 
asked for it when you send your first email. 

Now let's set SMTPeter as the main outgoing SMTP server. Go back to main 
account settings page and select SMTPeter as your Outgoing Server.  

![Set SMTP server](set_smtp_server.png "Set SMTP server")

And that's all the configuration you have to do!
