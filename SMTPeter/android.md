# Setting up Android

If you use the standard Android email app as your email client, and you want to send all 
your outgoing messages through SMTPeter, you can take the following steps
to connect to SMTPeter.

In the email app you go to settings in the left menu:

![Account Settings](copernica-docs:SMTPeter/Images/android-0.png "Go to account settings")


and a list will all your email accounts show up: 

![Account Settings](copernica-docs:SMTPeter/Images/android-1.png "email list")

Here you select the account for which you want SMTPeter to send your outgoing mails

Select the outgoing settings:

![Add SMTP server](copernica-docs:SMTPeter/Images/android-2.png "Outgoing settings")

Here you have to fill out our SMTP settings username and password: 

![SMTP settings](copernica-docs:SMTPeter/Images/android-3.png "Configure SMTP settings")

Now you have set up SMTPeter as the SMTP server for the account you have selected

And that's all the configuration you have to do!
