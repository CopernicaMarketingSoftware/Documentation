# REST API Overview

The SMTPeter API provides a powerful RESTful interface. 
Which means that your application can access the API using 
the HTTP protocol. 

## API Access Token

Before you can send a request to our API you will need to 
[create an API access token](copernica-docs:SMTPeter/dashboard/rest-api-token "Create REST API token documentation").
This token has to be added as a parameter to all of your API calls. 

## API Endpoint

All API methods are accessed via:

    https://www.smtpeter.com/v1/{METHOD}?access_token={YOUR_API_TOKEN}

 > **Note:** All API requests must use secure HTTPS connections. Unsecure HTTP requests will 
result in a 400 Bad Request response. 

## Sending email using the REST API

All messages sent through the REST API should **at least** contain the following variables:

    "envelope":     string with a pure email address
    "recipient":    string or array with a pure email address
    "recipients":   string with comma-separated email addresses


The request should, of course, also contain your email message. SMTPeter offers two ways  
to include your message when sending through our REST API:

  * You can send emails by adding the variable "mime", followed by the full mime
  message. 
  * You can also submit the different parts of your message, such as the subject and
  the html parts. 

Without the envelope, recipient or recipients variables, your email message, and a 
valid access key, your email cannot be sent.

If you want to use the mime variable, simply add the following variable to your request: 

    "mime":      string containing the full mime message


If you do not use the mime variable, you can add one or more of the following variables:


    "subject"           string containing the subject
    "from"              string containing the sender (email address)
    "to"                string or array containing recipients (email address)
    "cc"                string or array containing the cc addresses (email address)
    "text"              text version of the email
    "html"              html version of the email

 >**Note:** The 'from', to' and 'cc' variables only state what the MIME
 looks like, not who the actual recipients of the email are. The email
 will be deliver to the email address stated in the 'recipient' variable
 and not necessarily to the addresses stated in the MIME headers. The email
 addresses stated in the 'to' and 'cc' variables will (often) be the same
 as the ones stated in the recipient variable. 


### Additional variables for tracking and processing

SMTPeter also offers the following boolean variables (e.g. variable: true/false) 
that can be sent with each request. Including these variables and setting them 
to true or false will enable or disable the features for the email.   

    "inlinizecss":        When set to true, all CSS will be inlined inside the HTML
    "clicktracking":      When set to true, links will be redirected and tracked
    "bouncetracking":     When set to true, bounces will be tracked
    "openstracking":      When set to true, opens will be tracked

The variables can be either provided as regular POST data, or they can be encoded in JSON. If you
use JSON, the Content-Type should be set to application/json. 


### Envelope and recipient address notation 

The email addresses stated in the envelope and recipient variables have to
be **pure** email addresses. That means they should just contain the email
address without the name of the recipient or angle brackets ('<' and '>') 
(e.g. it should state 'richard@copernica.com' and not '"Richard" \<richard@copernica.com\>'). 

Both the envelope and recipient variables should only contain a single
email address. It is not possible to add multiple comma-separated addresses. 

### Adding multiple email addresses

It is possible to add multiple recipients either by by adding the `recipients' variable instead
of the recipient variable. The email addresses here have to be comma-separated. 

Examples:

```javascript
{
    "recipients": "one@example.com", "two@example.com", ...
}
```

### Email address notation for other variables 

The 'from' variable has to contain a **single** email address. However, 
the notation here is more flexible than the 'recipient' and 'envelope' 
variables. The 'from' variable may contain a name in front of the address
as well as angle brackets ('<' and '>')

The 'to' and 'cc' variables are even more flexible. Like the 'from' variable
they may contain a name and angle brackets. Unlike the 'from' variable they 
may contain multiple addresses. These can be added in the same way as
the 'recipient' variable, but also allow comma separated addresses:

Example:

```javascript
{
  "to": [
    "one@example.com",
    "two@example.com",
    " \"Number three\" <three@example.com>, <info@example.com>"
  ] 
}
```

Again, the 'from', 'to' and 'cc' variables are not actually used to determine
the recipients of the email and only to determine the MIME layout. Most users
will use the same values as the ones stated in the 'envelope' and 'recipient'
variables. 


### PHP examples

The example below illustrates how you can send an email with SMTPeter using PHP and cURL.

```php
<?php
// access token
$token = "your-api-token";

// create curl resource
$curl = curl_init("https://www.smtpeter.com/v1/send?access_token={$token}");

$data = array(
    'recipient'     =>  'reciever@example.com',
    'envelope'      =>  'sender@example.com',
    'subject'       =>  'This is a test mail',
    'text'          =>  'This is the body of the text mail',
    'from'          =>  '"Peter" <sender@example.com>',
    'to'            =>  '"John" <reciever@example.com>'
    
);

// set options
curl_setopt_array($curl, array(
    CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER      =>  1,
    CURLOPT_POST                =>  true,
    CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS          =>  json_encode($data),
    CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER          =>  array('content-type: application/json')
));

// $output contains the output string
$output = curl_exec($curl);

// clean up curl resource
curl_close($curl);
```
