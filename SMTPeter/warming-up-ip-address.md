#How to warm up an IP address

Some might say that email deliverability is Rocket Science. But with the right information,
you can ensure that your emails get delivered successfully. One of the key pieces
of information regarding email deliverability is warming up an IP address. Sending a large number
of emails immediately from a fresh new IP address, can get you deferred or blocked by ISP's
such as outlook.com, gmail.com. This is mostly because a new IP does not have a reputation score
since email has not been sent from it yet. The reputation score is an indication of the trustworthiness of
an email senderâ€™s IP address and is used by email providers and filters to determine additional
email filtering criteria.

Once you have warmed up an IP address succesfully, you can send large numbers of emails and get
through the ISP's killer filters with more success.

How to begin? Peter will show you how to start sending emails over a new IP address
without delivery failures.

##Why do you need to warm up an IP address?
As mentioned before, the main reason why you should warm up an IP address, is because that IP
does not have a reputation score. A new IP is considered 'cold'. And a good reputation score is not
achieved overnight. You need to start small and gradually increase the number of emails to
send larger volumes in the end.

## Do I need to warm up my IP address?
If you are a small sender, around 10,000 or less emails per month, you will most likely stay below
the radar of ISP's. There is no need to warm up an IP. But if you send more than 10,000 emails a month,
you should consider warming up your IP address.

## First things first...
Great, now that you know if you have to warm up or not, there are a few things you need to check first.
Ensure key email authentication methods (SPF, DKIM and DMARC) are in place.

Next, start sending only to recipients that have recently opened or clicked an email. In other words, your most engaged audience. Your reputation increases as more recipients open your email, and the ISPs will begin to accept more email from your IP address.
