# License and billing information

## Pay-as-you-go

SMTPeter's standard payment system is a so called 'pay-as-you-go' system:
you can top up your balance and the costs of any emails will be taken off 
that balance. You can send email as long as your balance is high enough to 
support the amount of emails you want to send (e.g. if your balance allows for
100.000 emails and you want to send 100.001 emails, you will have to top up
your balance). 

The first 10.000 emails every month are free and your email credits will never expire. 
That way you never pay more than you have to. 

The price of emails is variable and discounts are automatically calculated into
the price of your emails. If you have sent 100.000 emails, the 100.001th email will 
automatically be caluclated with the cheaper price per email. 

## Billing

All billing is done automatically, and at the end of each month you will receive
a receipt/invoice about your costs for the past month. 

## Other payment options

If you prefer to use a postpay option instead of the pay-as-you-go payment, you
can contact us at [info@smtpeter.com](mailto:info@smtpeter.com "email us") or
call at +31 (0)20 520 61 90. 

The post payment method means you will be invoiced
for the amount of emails you have sent at the end of each month. Of course the same
discounts as in the pay-as-you go payment system apply for the post payment system. 
This invoice has to be paid within two weeks of the invoice date. 

## License

Whilst SMTPeter has a pay-as-you-go payment system it does work 
with a license. This license means you have complied with our
[terms and conditions](copernica-docs:SMTPeter/terms-and-conditions)
and does not involve any costs.
