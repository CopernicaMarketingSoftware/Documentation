# SMTP credentials

In order to connect to SMTPeter through SMTP you will need to create 
an SMTP username and password. These credentials can be created and 
found in the [SMTP credentials tab](https://www.smtpeter.com/app/#/admin/smtp-credentials "SMTP credentials tab") 
on your SMTPeter dashboard. 

The SMTP credentials are generated automatically and can have 
certain [features of SMTPeter](copernica-docs:SMTPeter/features "SMTPeter features") 
enabled or disabled. You can create multiple logins with different 
features enabled. The SMTP credentials overview will show which features 
are enabled for each of your logins. 

 > **Note:** Your SMTP password will only be shown once when you generate
 your login credentials,  make sure to keep it somewhere safe. 

## Using multiple SMTP credentials

You can create multiple logins to enable or disable certain features of
SMTPeter. If, for example, you want to track clicks, opens and bounces, 
but do not want to inline your CSS for one set of emails, but do want to use 
all features for another set, you can create and use a separate login for each 
group of emails. All emails sent with a specific login, will only use the 
features enabled for that login.
