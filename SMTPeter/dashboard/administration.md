# Administration dashboard

The administration tab of your SMTPeter dashboard is where you can view and 
edit your administrative information. The dashboard consists of four different 
parts: Company, Users, License and Billing. 

## Company

In the Company tab you can view and edit your company's details. Make sure these
details are correct; they are used for billing purposes. Whilst Payment and bank details
are not shown in the overview, they can be viewed and changed by pressing the
`edit` button. 

## Users

In the user overview you can view and editor your current users or add new employees to
your company. Each employee can have their own account and login credentials for SMTPeter, 
there are no extra costs involved for using multiple accounts. 

By clicking on an employees portrait you can view their preferences and see their access rights, 
newsletter subscriptions and language preferences. If you have administrator rights for your company
 you can also change these settings for each employee. 

To add a new employee, press the `new employee` button in the top right of the menu bar. All
you need to do is add their email address and they will receive a link to create their own login. 

## License

In the license overview you can view the details of your license. It shows the type of license, which 
states whether you are using just SMTPeter, or SMTPeter is combination with 
[ResponsiveEmail](copernica-docs:SMTPter/responsive-email "ResponsiveEmail Documentation"). 


 > Having a license does not cost anything, hwoever it is neseccary to have a license, becuase it shows 
you have agreed with the SMTPeter terms and conditions. 

## Billing

This overview shows your invoices from the past 12 months. You can click on an individual invoice
to see more details about that specific invoice.
