# REST API tokens

IN order to use the SMTPeter REST API, you will need to generate an access 
token. You can do so in the [REST API token tab](https://www.smtpeter.com/app/#/admin/api-access "Create REST a API token")
of your SMTPeter dashboard. 

## How to create a token

To create a rest API token all you have to do is press the green `CREATE TOKEN`, 
button this will generate your personal API access token. Pressing the 
'REVOKE ACCESS' button, will revoke the access of the API token. Access for 
that specific can not be restored and a new token will have to be generated. 

 > **Note:** Pressing `CREATE TOKEN` when you already have a REST API token will override the
old API token and revoke its access. Afterwards you will have to use your new token to access
our API.
