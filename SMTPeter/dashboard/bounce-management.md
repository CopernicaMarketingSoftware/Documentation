# Bounce Mangement

In the Bounce Managment tab of your SMTPeter dashboard
you can configure what SMTPeter should do with bounces. 

A email is considered 'bounced' when it cannot be delivered, due 
to, for example, a full mailbox or a non existing recipient. It 
is considered good practice to remove unreachable addresses from 
your email list. 

## Managing Bounces in SMTPeter

You can set SMTPeter to react in three different ways when a bounce 
is received:

### Ignore bounces

You can choose to ignore bounces (not recommended), 
which means SMTPeter will receive the bounce message and do nothing.

### Forward the bounce message

You can also choose to let SMTPeter forward the bounce report to a 
specific email address. The bounce message will then be forwarded to 
this address where your own application can process it further. 

### Post the bounce message to a callback url

Another way to process bounces is to post the bounce report 
to a callback URL. This is the best way for your own application 
to further process the boucne message.
