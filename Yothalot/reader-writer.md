# The Yothalot Reader and Writer classes

Internally, Yothalot writes intermediate results to temporary GlusterFS files. 
The output from the mapper processes is for example written to such intermediate
files, which will then be used as input for the subsequent reducer processes. 
You normally do not have to read or write such files yourself, as they are fully
managed by Yothalot. But if you do want to create or read such files too, you 
can use the Reader and Writer utility classes.

The intermediate files generated by Yothalot can be useful for many use cases: 
they are compressed files that are splittable on 10MB boundaries. This means
that if you write data to such a file, you can later split up the file in 10MB
big parts, and each of these parts is a valid Yothalot file in its own right. 
This is different compared to most other compressed files, because if you would
cut a gzip compressed file into parts you end up with corrupt unreadable parts.


## The Yothalot\Path class

Each node in the Yothalot cluster has to be mounted to GlusterFS file system.
This is the only requirement: being mounted - it is not necessary that a 
Yothalot node actually uses a
