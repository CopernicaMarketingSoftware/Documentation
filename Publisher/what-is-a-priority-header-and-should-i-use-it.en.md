Copernica allows you to set the message priority when you compose a
document. You can use it to indicate if an email is of extraordinary
importance to you.

The priority header is set direcly above the document

If you use, of if you have ever used Outlook, you may have seen email
messages with a red exclamation mark next to it. What the sender of the
mail is trying to tell you with this, is that his or her mail is more
important than all the other mails that you have ever received and that
it deserves more attention.

They have activated this setting by including the priority header into
the mail. The question is: were these mails really more important to
you? We think this is up to the receiver of the mail to decide, not to
the sender of the mail.

Our advice: leave this setting untouched, do not use the priority
header. It may cause annoyance and there is even a chance that spam
filters indicate emails with priority headers as spam (senders of spam
also use this header to draw your attention).

Most email programs even ignore this header completely.

### What should I do to draw more attention in the subscribers inbox?

Use a good and catchy subject line. Come up with good content.
