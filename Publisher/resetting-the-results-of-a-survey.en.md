Once you've created and tested a survey, you'll want to reset the
results to zero before it goes live. You may also have other reasons to
want to reset the results to none.

You can find the option to do so in the **Survey**menu.

Make sure to [export](#) the existing results first before you reset, if
you wish to save them for later.

The software will always double check with you if you really want to
reset.

Once you have removed the answers, they are gone forever.
