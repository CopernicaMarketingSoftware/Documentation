With Copernica's selections, structuring your
[database](./creating-your-own-databases.en.md "Create your own databases")
is easier than ever! Use selections to optimize the quality of your
database and easily set up targeted campaigns. And don't worry, because
Copernica processes all changes in your databases so that your
selections are always up to date. 

Working with selections
-----------------------

All the contact data you save in Copernica can be used as rules for your
selections. For example, use them to filter contacts that opted in for
your newsletter.

Or use selections to filter on:

-   Field value. E.g. Set up a selection that checks if the value 'Place
    of residence' matches New York. All contacts located in New York
    will then be part of your selection.
-   Interest. E.g. Make a selection based on all contacts with an
    interest in Apple products.
-   Date. E.g. Make a selection for all contacts whose warranty is about
    to expire. The selection will then check if todays date is X amount
    of months from the purchase date.
-   Campaign result. E.g. Set up a selection of all contacts that
    clicked on a certain hyperlink in your last
    [emailing](./create-clever-emailings.en.md "Create clever emailings").
    This way, you can easily send your contacts a [follow up
    email](./automate-campaigns.en.md "Automate your campaigns").
-   Contact history. E.g. Select all contacts you didn't have contact
    with between date X and date Y.
-   Contents of another (mini) selection. E.g. Set up a selection that
    uses the content of another selection you made earlier. This is a
    handy way to select all contacts you haven't had contact with for
    more than six months and are interested in products from Apple for
    example.

 Always relevant because of dynamic selections
----------------------------------------------

Because of the dynamic nature of selections within Copernica, they will
always be updated automatically. Just set up a selection once, and after
that the selection will always contain the right information. If a
change has an influence on a selection, Copernica will always process
this change in your selection. So if someone opts out of your
[emailing](./automate-campaigns.en.md "Automate your campaigns") for
example, this person will immediately disappear from your selection.
This way, not only your selections, but also your campaigns will always
be relevant and up to date.

Feel free to combine selections
-------------------------------

Not entirely happy with the segmentation of your target group? With
Copernica you can easily combine different selections and selection
rules. You can do so by setting up AND and OR conditions.

-   With an AND condition, a selection has to apply to all selected
    rules. For example: a contact has to be in your
    [database](./creating-your-own-databases.en.md "Create your own databases")
    as an existing client AND live in the US.
-   With an OR condition, a selection only has to apply to at least one
    rule.
