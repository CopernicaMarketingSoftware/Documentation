The software allows you to send mobile messages (SMS) to a large group
of recipients at once. We call this a mobile mass mailing.

The optin rules for email marketing also apply to SMS mailings.

To send a mobile mailing you will need the following

-   A database or a collection with a [mobile
    field](https://www.copernica.com/en/support/database-and-collection-field-types).
    In this field you have stored the mobile numbers of the relations
    that you wish to contact with your mailings.
-   You need [valid mobile
    numbers](https://www.copernica.com/en/support/what-is-a-valid-mobile-number/)
    of the contacts you wish to target. They also need to have given you
    permission to receive mobile messages. The opt-in rules and
    legislations for email marketing also apply to mass mobile
    messaging.
-   A mobile document. This document can be personalized with data from
    the [profile or
    subprofile](https://www.copernica.com/en/support/sending-to-profiles-or-subprofiles)
    using [smarty
    coding](https://www.copernica.com/en/support/personalize-campaigns).

### Creating a mobile document

You can create a mobile document in the mobile component in the
software.

-   Go to the **Mobile**section.
-   Choose **New document**from the **Document menu**.
-   On the right you can directly start typing the message.
-   A mobile message can only have 160 characters. If you are using
    smarty code to personalize the message, keep in mind that message
    may exceed these 160 characters when it is personalized with profile
    data.

**Tip:**to see how your document is personalized with your test
destination, check the personalized checkbox in the lower toolbar of the
screen.

Messages longer than 160 characters can be split and sent in multiple
messages (you will come across this option when configuring the mass
mailing), but you really should avoid this being needed. \
\
**Keep the message short and to the point. Test the mailing before
sending the final mailing. If you refer to a web page, is the URL
correct? Is all the information in the mobile message correct?**

### Sending the mobile mailing

You probably already used the software to send a mass emailing already.
Sending a mobile mass mailing is accomplished in the same way, so you
are already familiar with the dialog. The only distinction is that there
are less options that can distract you.

Open the document you wish to send, and choose **Mass mailing** from the
**Mailing menu**.

-   You must first agree with the rules and netiquette.
-   Select the target of the mailing.
-   Configure when you wish to send the mailing.
-   Set the options for the mailing.
-   Click continue to go to the final step from where you can send the
    mailing.
