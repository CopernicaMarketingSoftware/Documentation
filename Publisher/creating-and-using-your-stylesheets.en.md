The Style component allows you to create new stylesheets using the
Stylesheet menu. \
The stylesheet is generic and contains tabs to create stylesheets for
general, RSS feeds, Atom feeds, surveys and web forms. **All in one file
seperated with tabs.**

You can compose each style sheet with example coding, or create an empty
stylesheet to start from scratch. The example CSS files comes with lots
of comments about the classes and how they can be manipulated.

### Testing the stylesheet

To test your stylesheet under Content, select the web form, survey or
feed. Then go to the **Preview tab** and select the stylesheet from the
list.

the preview tab alows you to preview an xslt or css with your webform,
feed or survey.

### Linking the stylesheet

To use the stylesheet with your document or template, find the so called
option in the template or document menu. Once you have linked a style
sheet, a new tab Style is added above the document or template. From
here you can instantly edit its rules.
