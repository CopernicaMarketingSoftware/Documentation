Besides the existing [integrations](https://www.copernica.com/en/support/integrations "Integrations") for different systems, with our powerful SOAP API you are able to create an integration with your own software. Synchronize all data from Copernica with the data from your own software to keep all information and your marketing campaigns up to date.

Copernica's SOAP API
--------------------

Copernica's SOAP API uses the SOAP standard. This means you'll be able to integrate the API in development environments as Java Netbeans and Microsoft Visual Studio. By using the SOAP standard, programmers will quickly be able to start working with Copernica. Also, the API can be invoked from every standard programming language and development environment.

Full control with Copernica's object model
------------------------------------------

Copernica's API uses a logical and structured object model. All data in the software is represented by objects. Read the properties of these objects with SOAP API and then update them. The methods can also be invoked. Every project is built up from smaller sub-objects. An object that represents a [database](http://www.copernica.com/en/features/profiles/creating-your-own-databases "Creating your own databases") for example, has a method that requests all documents that were created based on this [template](http://www.copernica.com/en/features/emailings/create-custom-templates "Create custom templates").

Use Copernica functionalities in the application
------------------------------------------------

The power of API is that all functionalities that can be executed in Copernica's user interface, can also be used in another application if you use the SOAP API. Use the API to build up databases for instance, or to create relation profiles, to create templates or to produce email documents.

Renewed callback system
-----------------------

By synchronizing data between Copernica and an external location or database, you don't have to keep [importing](http://www.copernica.com/en/features/profiles/import-and-export-data "Import and export data") data manually from Copernica and vice versa. Both systems do this fully automatically. In Copernica, one can easily set up callback URLs. Copernica will use this to keep the third party application informed about all changes in the database of Copernica.
