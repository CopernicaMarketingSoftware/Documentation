The blocks you use in Copernica for adding personalized content to PDF
files are not created in Copernica, but in Adobe Acrobat Pro. To be able
to create the blocks, you need to install the free PDFlib plugin for
Acrobat PRO.

Note: the plugin is **not**available for Acrobat reader.

After you have installed the Acrobat plugin, an additional menu called
**PDFlib blocks**appears in Acrobat.

To activate the tool, click the item **PDFlib block tool** in the new
menu. Draw a block where you want it. The exact size and position of the
block can be adjusted later if desired.

The dialog box for setting the block options will reveal itself...

Important settings
------------------

-   **Block name**- the name of the block. This name is also shown in
    Copernica at the block. So give it a descriptive name.
-   **Type** - choose the type of block you want to use. Select
    **Text**to add textual content. Select **Image**to add an image.
    There is also a **PDF** option, you can ignore this on.

### Change font and typography

You can customize the appearance of text in text blocks to your own
taste. Click the **Text** button, for example to change the*font size*,
*line spacing*et cetera.

**Note**: if the text spans multiple lines, make sure that the setting
**Text flow**is set to 'true'.

**Note 2**: all the fonts you want to use within the PDF blocks, need to
be uploaded to Copernica.

### Copying blocks

You can simply copy the blocks in Acrobat using the familiar CTRL+C and
CTRL+V key combinations. Mac users have a key with a picture of an
apple, with which the same can be achieved.

### Multiple blocks

You can add an infinite number of blocks to all pages in the PDF
document.
