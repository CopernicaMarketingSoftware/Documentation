The first time you send an emailing can be an exciting moment. Will it all go as planned? Is your emailing going to be delivered to the people intended and how will they respond? Luckily you arrived at the right place. This article addresses all subjects on successfully sending mass mailings with Copernica.

### Test before sending

You don't want to find out that you just sent a big grammatical boo boo to thousands of people, or that the email looks horrible in Gmail and that your _call to action_ link doesn't work at all. It is all a matter of testing, folks. Testing extensively.
