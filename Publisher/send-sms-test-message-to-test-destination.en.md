If you have a SMS document ready for shipment, it is wise to test it
first.

The function to send a test mail is found in the menu **Mailing** under
**Mobile**. Here you find some options, that will probably look
familiar.

-   You can select wether you want to personalize the message. When you
    use personalization code in the message the setting must obviously
    be activated.
-   You can also choose if the sending should appear in the campaign
    history of the test profile.
-   The test email will be sent to the mobile number from the test
    destination. In the database you have specified which (sub)profile
    field contains the mobile number for SMS messages.
