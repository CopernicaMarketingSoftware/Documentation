Web forms and surveys created under *Content* can only be published on
web pages within a website. You can create your own website under
Websites.

Create a new website from the **Website menu** under **Websites**.

The website is the collective name for all web pages you wish to publish
on the same domain. For example all pages of *newsletter.mycompany.com*.

### Create a new website

From the *Website *menu, choose *New website*

-   **Choose a name** for the website. This name is used in the software
    only, it is not your domain name.
-   Click on store to create the website.
-   Once you have created a website, it will be enlisted in the left
    overview under **Websites**.

The website has no pages yet. To make a web page, you need a web
template first.
