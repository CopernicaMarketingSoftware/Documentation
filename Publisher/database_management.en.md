Each marketing campaign starts with a contact database. You manage your database(s) in the Profiles section. A profile is a record in your database, for example with data of a single relationship. Databases can be extended with collections, for example you can store purchased products.
You manage databases, collections and (sub) profile data in the section Profiles.
