Profiles are selected based on the value of a field.

This type of condition roughly has two options:

1.  Profiles can be selected on based on the value in a particular
    field.
2.  Profiles can be selected by comparing two field values .\

#### 1. Compare a database field value with a value you specify here

Example: The value in the database field 'Newsletter' must be equal to
'Yes'

#### 2. Compare the value of two fields

Example: compare the value of field 'A' with the value of field 'B'.

Example: The value of the 'Email work' must be equal to the value of
'Email Private'

### Numerical comparison

Activate this option when numerical values ​​or fields are compared.

**Tip:** Create an index on the field that you are searching. This makes
the selection a lot faster.
