Web forms and surveys created under *Content* can only be published on
web pages within a website.

You need a web template to create your first web pages. [Read how to
create one]()

Select the website from the overview, and then select **new page** from
the page menu. In the appearing dialog window, select the template you'd
like to use for the page, and the name of the web page.

### Name of the page is also its web address

The name of the page is also used to to access the web page in the
browser later on. If you name the web page **ABC**, it can be accessed
via **http://linkeddomain.com/ABC**

### Different web templates under the same website

Unlike email documents, web pages under the same website do not
neccessarly have to be based on the same template. Different templates
can be used within one single website.

### Web pages and email documents

If you are already familiar with creating email documents, you will find
it easy to create a web page. Both processes work more or less the same
