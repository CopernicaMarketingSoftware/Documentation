When a web form is submitted, the visitor is automatically redirected to
the next page, also called the **landing page** or the **thank you
page**. This page can be set in the webform **Edit settings...** dialog
window.

You may use a web page created in Copernica, or use any externally
hosted website.

-   If you created a landing page made with Copernica: just enter the
    name of the web page.
-   Externally hosted website: enter the complete internet address of
    the page, including http://

### Personalization

Smarty personalization is allowed in this field. It is not needed to
include inlog code to your link. The login form already is taking care
of that. A user automatically gets logged in or out after submitting the
form (if you have an inlog form).
