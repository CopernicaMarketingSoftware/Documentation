In Copernica we distinguish between profiles and subprofiles. Profiles
exist at the database level, and subprofiles at collection level. If you
do not use collections, you always send your mailings to profiles (and
you can just skip this article).

### When do you send to subprofiles?

When the individual subscribers you want to target your campaign to, are
stored in a collection. Example, you want to approach the employees of
all companies, and you have stored the individual employees in a
collection at the company.

You need at least a mini selection, from which you have filtered all
possible unsubscribes.\
 When configuring the mailing, select the mini selection that you want
to use for the mailing. The mailing will be sent to all subprofiles in
the mini selection. At the database level, no segmenting will take
place. \
Not one database profile will receive a mail if the target of the
mailing is a miniselection.

Do you also want to use selections to only send emails to subprofiles
that belong to profiles that meet certain conditions? \
 Suppose you have a selection that you use to select companies in
Amsterdam. You can now send a mailing to just the employees
(subprofiles) of these Amsterdam based companies, by first expanding the
*Amsterdam*selection, then the *Employee*collection and finally the
*mini selection*.

This miniselection now only houses employees of companies in Amsterdam.
Only they are lucky enough to get your mail!
