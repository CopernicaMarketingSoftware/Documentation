**Sunday, November 25, 2012, 9.30 PM (CET) -**** **Because of a bug in
the script that creates new trial accounts in Copernica, tasks of the
accounts within one of our database servers were being performed slower
than usual since Friday night. In some cases this resulted in emailings
that were sent with a delay. This issue has been solved. \
 \
 **What does this mean for users?****\
**In some cases, emailings were sent with a delay. Also users might have
noticed tasks, such as building up selections, were being performed
slower than usual. 

**Were all emailings sent?****\
**Yes. All emailings were sent, although in many cases with a delay. \
 \
 **No user actions required****\
**No additional actions are required from our users. No data was lost
during this issue.
