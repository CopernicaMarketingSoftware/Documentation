Copernica improved the way it handles bounces, resulting in a lower
bounce rate. In a lot of cases, this means more emailings are being
delivered successfully to their recipients.

**What changed?** Up until now, whenever Copernica received a \*.1.1
notification from an email provider, it was handled as a bounce
immediately. In practice however, in some cases there proved to be other
reasons why a provider would return such a notification. Therefore, as
of this week, we try to offer the email multiple times.

**How will this affect your bounce rate?**\
 In some causes this will result in a bounce anyway, but other times it
will lead to a successful delivery of the e-mailing in question,
decreasing your bounce rate. In this case of course it could mean that
recipients will start receiving your emailings again after a while of
not getting your emailings.

**How will this affect your selections?**\
 Depending on the way you built up your selections, this could mean that
profiles will show in selections they werenâ€™t part of before. Or vice
versa.
