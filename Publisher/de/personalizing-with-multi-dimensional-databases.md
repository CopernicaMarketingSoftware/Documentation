**November 14, 4.25 PM  – **
Copernica Marketing Software version 12.45
will be released earlier than planned. Tonight at around 6.30 PM (CET)
we're upgrading the application. As of then users will be able to
personalize based on multidimensional databases. Also, we’re
implementing various updates that improve the overall application
performance.
**What’s new in Copernica 12.45?**
As of Thursday, users are able to personalize based on multiple
databases.
**What does this mean for users?**
Suppose you create two databases. One for companies and one for
employees. You could then, for example, state which employee works for
what company by referring the two databases to each other.
This would give you the possibility to personalize based on both the
company as the employee database, in one emailing.

**Any other updates?**
Yes, Thursday we’ll make various updates that improve the overall
performance of the application.
