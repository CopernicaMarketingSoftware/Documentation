**October 3, 2012, 14.30 PM (CET) -Â **Impressions and clicks that were
generated between 21:00 last night and 13:30 today (CET), will be
available in the statistics a little later than usual in some cases.
This is caused by the fact that the pic servers where the statistics are
stored, were unable to synchronize with the user accounts earlier today.
This has now been solved.\
 \
 We expect all statistics to be up to date at the end of the day. No
data was lost during the synchronization interruption. \
 \
 **What happened?\
**Impressions and clicks are stored on our pic servers. This data is
synchronized with user accounts. The synchronization however was
temporarily not available. At this moment this data is still being
synchronized, we expect all statistics to be up to date at the end of
the day.\
 \
 **Was any information lost? \
**No. All information is stored on the pic servers. No data was lost.
Impressions and clicks that were generated before yesterday evening
21:00 were available all the time. Impressions and clicks that were
generated between that time and 13:30 will remain stored on pic server,
and will all be available at the end of the day. \
 \
 **Is there anything users should do?\
**No actions from our users are required. In some cases however follow
up actions based on clicks and impressions might be executed with a
delay. In some cases selections could be based on slightly older
statistics. We expect this be solved at the end of the day.
