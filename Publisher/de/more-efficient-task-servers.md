**Monday, March 4 - **This weekend Copernica Marketing Software was
updated, improving the efficiency of our task servers. The planned
release that allowed users to restrict account access to certain IP
addresses has been postponed. \
\
**Task servers**\
Our task servers are now working more efficiently than before. As of 
now, large tasks are less likely to slow down other running tasks
because the servers divide the load more efficiently. Task servers are
the ones that  handle issues like sending emails or building
selections. 

Before this release, whenever one user sent out a large emailing, this
could affect the performance for other users that were performing
smaller tasks. This is now a lot less likely to be the case. 

**Restricted IP access\
**For this weekend we also planned an update that allowed users to
restrict their account access to certain IP addresses. This would allow
them to ensure that their account would only be accessed by their own
computers.\
\
This update has however been postponed, because we discovered some bugs
during beta testing that needed to be solved first.\
\
A new release date will be posted as soon as possible.
