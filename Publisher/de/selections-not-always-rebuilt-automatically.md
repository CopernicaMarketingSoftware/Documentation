**March 25 -** Due to technical difficulties, selections are not always
being rebuilt on time. As a consequence scheduled mailings will be sent
with a small delay.\
\
**What does this mean for users?** \
If you have scheduled emailings, it may take a little longer (about 15
minutes) before the mailing starts. Also some other tasks, such as
exporting data can be delayed. \
\
**Are all emailings being sent?** \
Yes. All emailings will be sent, although in many cases with a small
delay.  \
\
**What can you do** \
If your selection is not rebuilt after 30 minutes, you can start the
rebuild process manually. This can be done through the following steps.
Choosing the affected selection, then go to the Database management menu
and select Edit selections -\> Edit current selection.  From the tab
"Rebuild status" you can start the rebuild process manually.
