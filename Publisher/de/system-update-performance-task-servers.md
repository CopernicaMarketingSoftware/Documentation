Copernica is experiencing technical difficulties to its task servers.
Because of this interference there is a chance that your e-mailings
can’t be sent out and that it’s not possible start imports.

This interruption started at 12.00 PM (CET) and hasn’t been solved yet.
Our operations department is working hard on a solution. The disruption
has no effect on landing pages and images and hyperlinks in emailings
that have already been sent. Also, scheduled emailings and the software
interface are still working.

More information will follow as soon as we know more about the cause and
estimated time needed to fix this situation.

**Update, 14.29 PM (CET):** The issue has been solved. Everything is
working like normal. Users might still experience a small delay when
sending e-mails, because of the possible queue that resulted from the
interruption.
