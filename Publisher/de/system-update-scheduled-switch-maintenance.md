Wednesday the 22^nd^ of August at 22.00 (CET) we will be performing
scheduled maintenance to our switches. This maintenance will last for
about 10 minutes, and might result in down time during this period.\
 \
 This possible down time might result in:

-   An unaccessible application
-   Webpages not working
-   Delayed sending of scheduled emailings
-   Failure to load images and to redirect hyperlinks

The interruptions will last for no longer than 10 minutes. After that
the application will function like normal. \
 \
 There is no chance of data being lost during this maintenance. No
additional actions of our users are required.
