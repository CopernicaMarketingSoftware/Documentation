In documents and follow up actions (and more) users are able to use
conditions. To set certain terms to the deployment of a follow up action
for example. Or to show different images to men and women in an email
document. \
 \
 The underlying system that uses these conditions based on javascript
will be thoroughly changed as of November 2. Most users won’t notice
this change, but the following information is very important to everyone
that uses advanced javascript conditions in their campaigns. \
 \
 **What is changing? \
**As of November 2 Copernica will no longer be using javascript engine
Spidermonkey and will switch to the Chrome V8 engine. This change will
have a lot of positive effect on the speed with which the javascript
conditions are being evaluated. \
 \
 This will mean that emailings that use javascript conditions will be
composed a lot faster than before. Recipients will notice that loading
an email or webversion will be a lot quicker than before. \
 \
 **Less possibilities\
**The whole POM object model is accessible in the old implementation.
This will no longer be the case as of November 2. As of then, you will
only be able to use data from profiles and sub profiles. Using the name
of the template for example will no longer be possible. \
 \
 **Advanced conditions only\
**The update in the system is only of importance for everyone that uses
advanced javascript conditions. It is possible that these conditions
will not work anymore after the upcoming update. You do not have to take
any actions if you only use:

-   Simple conditions (value X must be equal to Y)
-   Smarty

**Contact**\
 If you use javascript conditions that possibly won’t work after the
upcoming update, we will contact you shortly. If you don’t hear from us,
this means your existing follow up actions will not be affected by this
change.\
 \
 Of course you are always free to contact our support department
yourself if you have any questions about this update.
