**UPDATED** - **Tuesday, December 4, 2012, 5.20 PM (CET) -** Due to
technical difficulties, tasks in Copernica are being performed slower
than usual at this moment.  Although at this point the situation has
improved since earlier, the issues aren't fully solved yet. 

Various users are still experiencing delays. We are not yet able to give
an indication when these issues will be fully solved. 

We understand that this is a vexing situation, and that's why we are
working hard to come up with a solution. \
\
We kindly ask for your patience until we have one.

**What does this mean for users?**

In a lot of cases, emailings are sent delayed. Also users might notice
selections being slower than usual.  Furthermore, file imports/exports
and follow up actions are being performed slowly, and statistics will be
available later than usual. 

**Are all emailings being sent?**\
Yes. All emailings will be sent, although in many cases with a delay. \
\
**No user actions required****\
**No additional actions are required from our users. No data will be
lost as a result of this issue.
