**Wednesday, March 6 -** Some of our users were experiencing issues with
imports while using Copernica yesterday. Imports were slower than
usual. \
\
This issue has been solved, all imports are now performing as usual. The
slower imports did not directly affect emailings, scheduled emailings
were not delayed because of this issue. 

No existing data was lost. No additional user actions are required.
