Are you a Copernica SOAP API user? For an optimal performance we then
advise you to send SOAP API requests to soap.copernica.com. Log in using
the email address that belongs to the API user, instead of using a
username.\
 \
 The soap.copernica.com servers are especially set up to deal with SOAP
API calls and are suited better to handle these requests. To be able to
connect with these servers you have to log in using the API user email
address and password.
