This Thursday, 11 July, we will switch to a new internet connection for
our servers. This new connection offers better redundancy, ensuring the
software remains accessible at all times. The new connection also offers
lower latency, thereby increasing speed.\
\
As a result of this switch, the Copernica Marketing Software will not be
reachable for several minutes on Thursday morning, 11 July starting
around 07:00 (CEST). There will be no consequences for scheduled tasks.
Any mailings sent out around this time will be delayed by several
minutes.
