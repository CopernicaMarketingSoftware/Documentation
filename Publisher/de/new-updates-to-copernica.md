This morning we updated Copernica Marketing Software, improving the
performance of two different parts

**Content\
**We improved the way our software loads article overviews, reducing the
time the application needs load article overviews in the 'Content'
section of Copernica.Â 

**Automatic replies**\
We have enhanced the processing of incoming automatic replies, such as
bounces, out of office messages and etcetera. By doing so, we were able
to make this component of the software more efficient and accurate,
improving its overall performance.
