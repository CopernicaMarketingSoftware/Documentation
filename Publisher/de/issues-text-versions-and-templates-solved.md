**Thursday, November 15, 9.50 AM (CET) - **The issues with templates and
text versions have been solved. Earlier this morning it was not possible
to edit email and website templates, or to save (changes) in text
versions of emailings. 

**Did this issue affect any other features?**

No. This interruption did not affect other Copernica features. It was
still possible to edit text blocks and other content in emailings. Also,
emailings were being sent out as usual. No data was lost as a result of
this interruption.
