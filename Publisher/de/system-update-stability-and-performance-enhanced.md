August 30, 16.00 (CET) - The stability of Copernica Marketing Software
has enhanced and the performance of the application has even improved.
We apologize for any inconvenience caused by the interruptions in the
last period.   \
\
**24/7 monitoring\
**24 hours a day we are keeping an eye on Copernica Marketing Software.
Any time of the day software engineers and support representatives are
available to monitor the performance of the application and our servers.
In the last four days the application has been working without
interruptions. \
\
**Server park expanded\
**Today we installed various new database servers, that will help reduce
the workload on the servers that were already active. Also, we improved
some queries that manage the division of data traffic on our servers. \
\
**Upcoming developments\
**Currently we’re working on improved algorithms and on a better
division of our data traffic. Also we are working on an automated system
that alerts us whenever there is an interruption. We are also improving
the communication to our users by making product updates visible on
several different locations. We are also working on an event based
system for clicks, impressions that help decrease the build time for
selections and statistics. \
\
These improvements will help us realize an overcapacity in the near
future, ensuring a stable application with an excellent performance. \
