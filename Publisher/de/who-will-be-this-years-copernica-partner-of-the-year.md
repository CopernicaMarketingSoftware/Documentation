**Copernica’s partner network is growing**

This second edition of Copernica Partner of the Year proves that the
partner network of Copernica has grown significantly this past year! Not
only did we welcome more partners in the Netherlands but the network
also grew in Germany, Belgium, England and France.

This growth also leads to a better commitment from the partners towards
Copernica. Several [articles are written together with
partners](./get-the-most-out-of-the-partner-license.md#joint-content),
[trade shows are
attended](./get-the-most-out-of-the-partner-license.md#trade-shows)
and [succesful seminars are
organized](./get-the-most-out-of-the-partner-license.md#organize-a-seminar).
All different initiatives showing the involvement and passion the
partners have to spread Copernica's reputation (inter)nationally.

Thanks to this international expansion of the partner network, it has
become easier for Copernica users to select a partner who is able to
help them with their specific needs and questions. Whether they are
looking for someone to assist them with designing email templates,
creating websites or setting up a customer database. Copernica's partner
network offers the right solution for every one.

How can you claim the title?
----------------------------

This top 50 of partners who are eligible to win the title of Copernica
Partner of the Year 2013 is a snapshot. The title of Partner of the Year
is determined based on a number of different factors you can also [find
on
copernica.com](./get-the-most-out-of-the-partner-license.md#organize-a-seminar).
Points have been given to these factors enabling us to create a final
ranking. The higher you rank, the more likely the chance of being
nominated as Partner of the Year. Furthermore, we check whether you have
already [registered as a partner of Copernica](./register-as-copernica-partner.md)
and if you appear in Copernica's partner network.

Selection for Copernica's Partner of the Year is based on:

-   Total growth in revenue since 2012
-   Number of active accounts in Copernica
-   Use of Copernica for own campaigns
-   Joint marketing activities:
    -   [Participating at trade shows](./get-the-most-out-of-the-partner-license.md#trade-shows)
    -   [Organizing joint seminars](./get-the-most-out-of-the-partner-license.md#organize-a-seminar)
    -   [Publishing joint content](./get-the-most-out-of-the-partner-licens.md#joint-content)
    -   [Linkbuilding towards copernica.com](./get-the-most-out-of-the-partner-license.md#mention-the-partnership)
-   Number of [certified Copernica users](./get-the-most-out-of-the-partner-license.md#become-an-expert)

At this moment the scores within the top 50 and even the top 70 are not
that far apart. That means that by doing just that little bit extra
could get you into that top 50. For example by writing and publishing an
article or participating at a trade show. Do you want to know what you
