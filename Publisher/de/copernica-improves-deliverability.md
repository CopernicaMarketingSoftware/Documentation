**October 18 2012, 12.35 PM (CET) - **To increase our users’
deliverability, Copernica has changed the setting of our servers. In
some cases, the previous setting could cause certain emails not be
delivered correctly.\
 \
 Some receiving email servers verify the sender address of an incoming
party with the sending party. Because of the way our servers were set up
however, in some cases receiving servers weren’t able to check if an
email address existed. In some cases, this could cause emails not be
delivered.  \
 \
 In the meanwhile we have changed our setting so that receiving parties
are always able to check if an email address exists. In some cases this
might lead to an improved deliverability.
