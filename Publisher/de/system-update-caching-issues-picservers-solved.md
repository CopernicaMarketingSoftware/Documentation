Because of an interruption on a small amount of our pic servers, between
14.00 and 14.50 (CET) today, to a limited extent wrong images were
shown. This only had effect on emailings and webpages that were opened
during this time frame. \
 \
 The disruption has been solved and all images are now being loaded
correctly. A web browser or email client’s cache memory could however
cause incorrect images to be shown in emailings or webpages.\
 \
 This can be solved by, as a recipient opening the webpage or web
version of an emailing, and to refresh the page with CTRL+SHIFT+R or
CTRL+F5 (depending on your web browser).\
 \
 During this interruption no data has been lost. No additional actions
from our users are required.
