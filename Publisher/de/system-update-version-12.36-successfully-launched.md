**October 2^nd^, 22:39 (CET) –** Copernica Marketing Software version
12.36 has been successfully released. This update comes with various
improvements:\
\
**Emailings are sent out quicker\
**Emailings no longer have to wait for the chosen selection to be
rebuilt before being sent out, as used to in previous versions.\
\
As of version 12.36, emailings are sent out while the selection is being
built, allowing it to be sent out a lot quicker. \
\
**Sharing statistics****\
**Version 12.36 contains a fix that enables users to directly share
statistics with a co-worker from the application. This used be possible
only if you downloaded a document first, and then sent it to someone
else per email for example. \
\
**Overall performance****\
**For version 12.36 we made a lot of improvements to the software that
increase the overall performance of the application. As a result,
Copernica performs a lot quicker and we are be able to secure the
stability of the application even more.
