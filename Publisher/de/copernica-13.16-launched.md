**May 15, 2013**Â - Copernica 13.16 comes with several bugfixes and
performance enhancements. Following Google's decision to no longer
accept weak DKIM keys, we've increased the minimum length of our DKIM
keys to 1024 bits. These longer DKIM keys will improve the
deliverability of your emailings.

The online help documentation has changed. The documentation has been
rewritten for a large part and the articles are presented in a clearer
structure. If you have any comments, we'd love to hear that from you.
Also if you think anything is missing, please let us know via
documentation@copernica.com. The online documentation is now available
for viewing via the software as well as through
[./help-documentation.md](./help-documentation.md).

Please note that the SOAP API documentation temporarily unavailable. We
expect it to be available again within hours.
