While the DDoS attack on our picservers is still ongoing, we have
managed to reduce the delays caused by the attack. You may find that it
takes a while to establish a connection, but once the connection is
made, images should load fairly quickly. We will continue to fight the
attack until normal service is restored.

A DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack is an attempt to make a
machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users, by firing
and endless number of unnecessary requests to our servers.

Despite this attack, the safety of Copernica user data is in no way at
stake. Also, emailings are being sent out according to schedule and
without delays. The only disadvantage user will experience is that the
picservers are operating slower than usual.
