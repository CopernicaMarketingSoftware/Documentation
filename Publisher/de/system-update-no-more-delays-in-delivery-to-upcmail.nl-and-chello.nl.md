**October 4, 2012, XX.XX XM (CET) â€“**Emailings from Copernica users to
addresses with the domain names upcmail.nl and chello.nl are once again
being delivered without any issues.\
 \
 Previously, delays could occur in the delivery of these emailings
because of erroneous settings in the receiving mail server of UPC. The
company has now changed their settings. \
 \
 Do you have any questions about emailings to addresses that end with
upcmail.nl and chello.nl? Feel free to contact our support department.
