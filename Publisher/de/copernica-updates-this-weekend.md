This weekend, we will be updating Copernica Marketing Software.\
\
**Task servers**\
This Sunday we'll improve the efficiency of our task servers. After this
update, large tasks are less likely to slow down other running tasks
because the servers divide the load more efficiently. 

**Restricted IP access\
**Also on Sunday, we’ll add an option that’ll enable users to restrict
access to their account to certain IP addresses or ranges. This way
they’ll be able to ensure that their accounts are only accessed by their
own computers.
