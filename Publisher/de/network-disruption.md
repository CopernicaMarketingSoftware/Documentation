**May 2, 2012 -**Copernica are currently facing a disruption in the
network. This means that the application's interface may respond slower
than usual. Because of this, some dialogs may load very slowly or may
fail to load completely. We are currently working with our provider to
find a solution to this problem.

This disruption will not cause any loss of data. All scheduled tasks
will be executed on time.
