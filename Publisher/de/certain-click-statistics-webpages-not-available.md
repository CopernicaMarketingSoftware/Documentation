**Wednesday, December 5, 9.50 AM (CET) –**Certain click statistics over
Copernica hosted websites aren’t available the software.\
 \
 This concerns all clicks in Copernica hosted websites that were made
between November 29 and yesterday evening. Because of erroneous settings
these were not registered an cannot be retrieved. \
 \
 For everyone that uses [Google
Analytics](http://www.copernica.com/de/support/integrationen/google-analytics)
however, these statistics are still available in that application.\
 \
 We corrected the settings, ensuring that all click statistics are now
once again being registered.
