****November** 12, 2012, 2.30 PM (CET) – **Because of a lot pressure on
our servers, tasks that were performed between 1.30 and 2.30 PM were
executed slower than usual. Especially building selections and
importing/exporting data were being executed with delays. The situation
has been solved. \
\
**What does this mean for users?\
**Mailings that were scheduled between 1.30 and 2.30 PM in a lot of
cases were sent out with delays with a maximum of an hour. \
\
The delays also affected emailings that were sent out manually, and the
performance of other tasks, like importing/exporting data.\
\
**Was any data lost?\
**No. No data was lost.\
\
**Are there any actions required from our users?\
**No. No additional actions are required from our users.
