We have installed a new database server. Tonight, we will be moving the
data from several accounts from one database server to this new database
server. This process will decrease the workload for both database
servers and will improve the performance of the application.

During this move, no data will be lost. However, as a result of this
process, the application could be unaccessible for a few minutes.
Scheduled tasks and e-mailings will be performed as planned. No further
action from our users is required.
