Saturday the 10th of August, we performed some maintenance tasks on our
network. During this maintenance window, we replaced controllers and
harddisks in some of our servers. These will bring better performance,
especially to our database servers. We also replaced a faulty system
board on one of our Dell M1000e blade chassis'.\
\
All in all, maintenance took a bit longer than the projected four hours,
but we still managed to get things wrapped up before daybreak.\
\
The replacement of these parts was the last in a long series of hardware
upgrades performed over the last year and will allow us to take our
performance to a higher level.
