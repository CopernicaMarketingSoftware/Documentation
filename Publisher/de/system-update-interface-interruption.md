**UPDATE, 12:43, (CET): Technical issues solved\

**The software interface is now functioning without any issues. The
interruptions were caused by a bug in the external software Copernica
works with. This error has been repaired with a bug fix from the
supplier. \
 \
 Also, by doubling the capacity of our mail senders, we solved the issue
with the delayed emailings. Emailings that are already delayed are being
sent out at this moment. New (scheduled) emailings will be sent
according to schedule.\

 During the interruption no data was lost. No additional actions from
our users are required.
