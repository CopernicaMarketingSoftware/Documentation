**March 6 – ****Due to** technical difficulties, emailings that were
scheduled to be sent between 2.45 PM and 6.25 PM today (CET) were sent
out with a delay in many cases. This interruption did not affect
emailings that were sent out manually.  Also, follow up actions and
scheduled imports and exports were performed delayed. This issue has
been solved.  \
 \
 **Were all emailings sent?****\
**Yes, as soon as the issues was resolved, all scheduled emailings were
sent out, although in many cases with a delay. Follow up actions,
imports and exports were also be performed as soon as the interference
was solved. \
 \
 **Were all emailings affected?\
**No. Emailings that were sent out manually were sent out in time,
although possible follow up actions might have been performed with a
delay. **\

 No existing data was lost as a result of this interference. No
additional user actions are required.
