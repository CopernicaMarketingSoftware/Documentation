**Friday, January 11 - **Tasks in Copernica were performed slower than
usual between last night 10.30 PM and this morning 8.30 AM (CET). This
resulted in emailings being sent out delayed. Although this issue has
been solved, the application is still working on catching up with
delayed tasks, causing it to be performing somewhat slower than usual. \
\
**How did this affect users?\
**Emailings were sent out delayed between 10.30 last night and 8.30 this
morning. Also, selections were being built slower and it took longer
than usual to import or export data to or from the application.
Currently, the application might be slower than usual.**\
\
Were all emailings sent out?\
**Yes. All emailings were sent out, although in many cases with a
delay. **\
\
Is user action required?\
**No additional actions are required from our users. No data will be
lost as a result of this issue.
