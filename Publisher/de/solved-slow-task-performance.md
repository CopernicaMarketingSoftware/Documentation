**Friday, November 23, 2012, 1.30 PM (CET) -**Because of a peak in
traffic on our servers, tasks in Copernica were being performed slower
than usual this morning. In many cases this resulted in emailings that
were sent out delayed. This issue has been solved. \
 \
 **What does this mean for users?\
**In a lot of cases, emailings were sent delayed. Also users might have
noticed selections being slower than usual.  Also, file imports/exports
and follow up actions were being performed slowly, and statistics were
available later than usual. \
 \
 **Were all emailings sent?\
**Yes. All emailings were sent, although in many cases with a delay. \
 \
 **No user actions required\
**No additional actions are required from our users. No data was lost
during this issue.
