**January 8, 2012, 8 PM (CET) - **This evening, Copernica 12.49 has been
launched. This version comes with several improvements that enhance the
overall performance of the software. \
\
The earlier announced upgrade of our [HTML parsing
engine](http://www.copernica.com/en/about-us/news/copernica-12-49-release-what-are-we-working-on) has
not been included in this release. Because the new engine still requires
some tweaking before it’s ready for usage, we have to postpone its
release to an upcoming Copernica update.
