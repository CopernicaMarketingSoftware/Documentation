Currently it’s a bit busy on our servers. That’s why some users might
experience their selections being built slower than usual. We ask for
your patience, we are working hard on solving this. \
\
Depending on the size and criteria of the selection, the delay can last
from 1 to 50 minutes. This has no impact on the further stability of
Copernica. You don’t have to fear for downtime or any major
interruptions.\
\
At the moment the build time for selections is already decreasing. Early
this afternoon (CET) the selections will build as usual. \
\
Are your selections still building slower than usual by then? Please
contact our [support
staff](http://www.copernica.com/en/articles/support), they will be happy
to help you with a solution.
