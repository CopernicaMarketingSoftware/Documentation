**Friday, January 11 -** In contrast to previous information, we will
not be conducting planned maintenance to Copernica this weekend. \
 \
 In an earlier notification, we announced that our service could be
interrupted at several moments this weekend as a result of maintenance
work. \
 \
 This no longer applies. \
 \
 Users can now schedule emailings to be sent out this weekend, without
having to take delayed emailings into account. **\
