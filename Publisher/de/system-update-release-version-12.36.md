Tuesday the 2^nd^ of October at 20:00 (CET) we are launching Copernica
Marketing Software version 12.36. This version comes with the following
updates:\
\
**Emailings are sent out quicker\
**Before an emailing is sent, the chosen selection has to be rebuilt.
Especially with bigger selections this meant that it could take a while
between the moment an emailing was scheduled to be sent out, and the
moment it was actually sent. \
\
As of version 12.36, emailings are sent out while the selection is being
built, allowing it to be sent out a lot quicker. \
\
**Sharing statistics\
**Version 12.36 contains a fix that enables users to directly share
statistics with a co-worker. At the moment it is only possible to share
a document if you download it first, and then send it to someone else
per email for example. \
\
**Overall performance\
**For version 12.36 we made a lot improvements to the software that
increase the overall performance of the application. As a result,
Copernica will perform a lot quicker and we will be able to secure the
stability of the application even more.
