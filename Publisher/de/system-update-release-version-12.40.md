Copernica successfully launched version 12.40 of the software. As of
now, follow-up actions based on webforms will be able to use information
from subprofiles. Also, we made some enhancements that improve the
overall performance of the software.\
 \
 **What are subprofiles?****\
**With the help of subprofiles you can add extra information to the
profiles in your database. Add contact information for multiple contact
persons of a company for example. Or include data on what products
someone bought in your webstore. \
 \
 The biggest advantage of subprofiles is that they enable you to
communicate with your relations on a more personal and direct way. And
as of now you will also be able to use this information for follow-up
actions based on webforms. \
 \
 **Follow up actions and sub profiles****\
**As of now users will be able to get more out of subprofile
information. Follow up actions based on web forms will then be able to
use this information. This means you are now enabled to, for example: \
 \
 - Set up follow up mailings based on subprofile information\
 - Use webforms to edit the information in subprofiles\
 \
 **Other improvements****\
**Version 12.40 contains various improvements and bug fixes that enhance
the overall improvement of the software.\
