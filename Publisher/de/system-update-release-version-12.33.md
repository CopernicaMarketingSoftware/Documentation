Update - September 6, 20.40 (CET) - Version 12.33 of Copernica Maketing
Software has been released. This upgrade comes with several
improvements: \
\
**Improved database performance\
**By reducing the number of (unnecessary) connections made to our
database, its performance will improve in version 12.33. This will also
improve the  functioning of the application and the website. \
\
**Enhanced picserver performance\
**With the help of improved scripts, as of version 12.33 we will be able
to decrease the workload on the picserver, enhancing its performance
speed. \
\
As a result, webpages and images will load faster and hyperlinks will
take less time to redirect. The statistics overview will also load
quicker. \
\
In addition, R&D is working on renewed send algorithms that will
decrease the workload on the picservers even more for upcoming
releases.\
\
**Content feeds\
**Content feeds as well as categories can no longer be loaded through
the SOAP API. \
\
**No spaces in media libraries\
**Names of new media libraries are no longer allowed to contain spaces.
The same goes for new images. This is to reduce the risk of load errors
in the HTML source code. Existing libraries and images with spaces will
continue to work.
