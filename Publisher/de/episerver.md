About EPiServer
---------------

The integration with EPiServer is facilitated within the Administration
mode, enabling a one-time or sychronizing link with Copernica. Using
this link, the fields from EPiServer can easily be extended and linked
to the profile database in Copernica.

EPiServer is mainly used by high-end websites because of its powerful
community functionality and personalization options.

*This Copernica integration is developed by a third party. Copernica is
not responsible for the proper working of this integration.*
