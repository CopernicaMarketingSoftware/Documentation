**Friday August 2, 9.43 AM (CET) - **Currently it’s not possible to view
invoices on Copernica.com. Also, some users received an erroneous
invoice yesterday.

At this moment users cannot log in to the invoice environment on
Copernica.com. We are working on a solution. As soon as the invoice
environment is working again, users will be notified in a product
update.

Also, some users were wrongly emailed an invoice, or received an
erroneous invoice. We are still investigating which users were sent
these flawed emails, and will notify them through email as soon as
possible.
