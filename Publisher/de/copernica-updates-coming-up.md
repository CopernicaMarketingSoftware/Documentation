Yesterday night Copernica Marketing Software was updated: **\
\
****Restricted IP access**\
Users now have the option to restrict access to their account to certain
IP addresses or ranges. This way they’ll be able to ensure that their
accounts are only accessed by their own computers.

Later today there will be a second update: 

**Spam complaints & bounces\
**Whenever a feedback loop returns a  spam complaint that cannot be
recognized automatically, Copernica will forward the message to our
support department so they can manually process the feedback. Also
certain bounces will be recognized and processed better than before.
