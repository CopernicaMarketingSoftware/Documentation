**Thursday, January 31 -** This afternoon Copernica has adjusted the use
of the domain name picsrv.net to vicinity.nl. All references within
Copernica to picsrv.net have been changed to vicinity.nl.\
\
**What is the picserver domain?**

When sending an emailing with Copernica, all of the clicks, impressions
and images of this emailing are processed by a dedicated server. This
server is accessed through a specific domain name: the picserver domain.
Until this afternoon, vicinity.picsrv.net was set as the default domain
name for users of Copernica. This has now been switched to
pic.vicinity.nl. This was done because picsrv.net was included on the
small blacklist SURBL. No additional actions are required from our
users.\

**Did you know...**

Did you know that as a user of Copernica and administrator of your
account, you can use your own picserver domain? You can do this by going
to 'Admin' within your account. In the Account menu, go to 'Delivery
settings' and select the tab 'Picserver domain'. Choose the option 'Use
your own picserver domain' and add your own domain name in the field
'Value'. The benefit in using your own picserver domain is that you are
the sole user of this domain name and you do not need to share it with
other users.
