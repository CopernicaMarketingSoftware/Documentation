The application was temporarily unreachable for some users today (July
9th, 2012) between 08:45 AM and 08:50 AM. This happened because we have
started using our new loadbalancer. During this time no data was lost,
all tasks were executed and all emailings were sent properly. There is
no need for you to perform any extra actions.
Â 
The new loadbalancer divides the workload of the application over our
different servers. For instance, this means that more users can use the
application at the same time. The addition of this new loadbalancer will
increase the speed and user-friendliness of the application.
