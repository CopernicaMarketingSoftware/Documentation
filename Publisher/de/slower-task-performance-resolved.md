technical difficulties, tasks in Copernica were being performed slower
than usual on Monday and Tuesday. This issue has been solved.\

Yes. All emailings were sent, although in many cases with a delay. As of
today, all emailings are being sent as usual.

stability of our application on the short as well as the long term.
Also, we planned several updates for the coming months that will enhance
the software performance.
