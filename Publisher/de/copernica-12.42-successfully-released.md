**October 22, 11.30 PM (CET) - **Copernica Marketing Software version
12.42 is successfully released. \
\
**What’s new in Copernica 12.42?****\
\
****Content module**\
The content module has been improved in the following ways: 

-   The possibility to search for articles
-   When a new article is created, the edit dialog stays open
-   Selected articles are highlighted in the grid
-   The layout for an article has changed
-   Only relevant information is displayed, keywords are removed and the
    size of the title is displayed

**Website\
**A button ‘keep me logged on’ was added to the Copernica.com website,
so that users don’t have to enter the username and password every time
they visit the website. Be aware not to use this functionality on a
public computer.\
\
An error, that caused visitors of the https:// version of the
Copernica.com to automatically redirect to the http:// version of the
website when they clicked on certain links, has been fixed. \
\
All country domains will be redirected to the .com
website. [www.copernica.de](http://www.copernica.de/) for example will
now redirect to [www.copernica.com/de](http://www.copernica.com/de).
Existing (deep)links that use the old URL structure will still work and
be redirected. \
\
**Partners\
**As of version 12.42 partners are once again able to change the layout
of the application (the red bar above the application, the logo,
etcetera) to their own liking.\
\
**Incident statistics\
**Incident statistics were broken and not working in the previous
version. This has now been fixed.
