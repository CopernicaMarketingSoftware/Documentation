**October 2, 17:30 (CET) - **Because of erroneous settings in UPC’s
incoming mailserver, e-mailings from some Copernica users have been
accepted with a delay or not at all. This only affects emails sent to
upcmail.nl and chello.nl domain names between the 16th of september and
earlier today. \
\
Only a limited number of users were affected by this. None of
Copernica’s IP addresses were blacklisted by UPC. \
\
In the meanwhile, UPC has changed the settings and most emails sent to
upcmail.nl en chello.nl are now being delivered. This could mean that
some recipients will receive emailings today that were sent earlier in
the last few weeks.\
\
Users that still have issues with sending emails to upcmail.nl and
chello.nl addresses can contact contact our support department.
