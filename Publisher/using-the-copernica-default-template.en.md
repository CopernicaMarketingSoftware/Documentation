For new users to get familiar with template and documents in Copernica,
we offer an example email template and document, that is easily created.
The template makes use of all common techniques, such as the webversion
link, and dynamic content blocks. This article explains how you load the
(prehistorical looking) default template into your account.

Prehistorical or not, the template however provides a good example of
how you can create dynamic templates with Copernica. It does by all
means NOT illustrate how a nice looking template is created :)

### Load the default template

-   In the Template menu under Emailings, click **New template**
-   Enter a name for the new template
-   Choose the smarty version, preferrably Smarty 3. (You will learn
    more about Smarty later).
-   Choose '*Fill template with example code*' and then the language of
    the content of the document. The Example template comes with a
    prefilled document in the language of your choosing.
-   Click **store**to create the template

The template is now created and available in the list with templates and
documents in the left overview. Click on the plus-sign to the left of
the template name to expand all documents under this template. There
should be at least one document \<*example*\> available. Click on its
name to open the example document (if it's not already).\

other is in *Edit mode*. 

### **Add or edit document content**

The great thing about templates is that they can be used over and over
again. To add content (text and images) to the documents under that
template, three types of content blocks are available:

-   [Text
    blocks](https://www.copernica.com/en/support/the-text-function-for-adding-textual-content-to-your-document)
    – Used to add textual content to your document
-   [Image
    blocks](http://www.copernica.com/en/support/the-image-function-for-adding-images-to-your-document)
    – Used to add images to your document
-   [Loop
    blocks](http://www.copernica.com/en/support/the-loop-function-to-iterate-content-in-your-email)
    – Used to iterate text and image blocks in your document

The default template / document makes use of all three block types. The
document has been prefilled with information about the block types and
how they are used. 

To edit the content of the document, switch to **Edit mode** (you find
this option the lower tool bar). In Edit mode, the blocks are clickable.

Click on a block to edit its content.

### Webversion and unsubscribe link

The template already has a working link to the webversion. You may take
a look in the Template source code how such a link is added. The
template source code is opened from the tab **Template source**, right
above the document.

In the template footer you'll find the unsubscribe link. Note that this
unsubscribe will not work until you configured the [unsubscribe
behaviour](http://www.copernica.com/en/support/setting-unsubscribe-behaviour-for-your-database-or-collection)
on the database of your[test
destination](http://www.copernica.com/en/support/help-documentation).
