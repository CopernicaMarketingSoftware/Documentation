By default a Content feed article consists of a title, full article and
a summary. If you have additional information to show to your readers,
you can define extra  fields. You can for example create an extra
field *email*, to show the author's email address in an article to which
readers can respond.

Extra fields are always created for a category. You can then fill in the
extra fields at each article in the category.

How to create an extra field:

-   **Select the category** for which you want to use the extra fields
-   Choose **Edit extra fields**... in the Article menu.
-   Create the new field and then click **store**.

In the dialog for editing an article in this category a new tab **Extra
fields** is added, allowing you to enter additional information for the
article.
