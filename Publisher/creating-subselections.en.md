To keep your database segments orderly and clean, you can create new
selections under a parent selection. A selection on a second level we
call a subselection. \
Profiles in a subselection comply to both the subselection and its
parent selection(s).

A subselection is created in the same way as a normal selection. When
creating the selection, you select under which selection you want to
create the subselection.

In the image below, the subselection is created under **Mailinglist**.
There already are two subselections under Mailinglist: Female and Male.

In the overview of databases and selections, you can expand the
subselections of a selection by clicking on the plus sign.
