A database or a selection can be archived. This means that the data
inside is maintained, but the database or selection is not normally
visible in your list of databases under Profiles. This function can be
used to keep a tidy overview of your data.

Select the database or selection you wish to archive from the list under
Profiles. Choose the Archive function under 'current view'
