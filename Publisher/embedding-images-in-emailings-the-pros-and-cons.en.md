When setting up a mass mailing, you have the option to either embed the
images in the mailing, or leave them on the server. Both options have
advantages and disadvantages. We will present you with both, so you will
be able to make a well-informed decision.

Leaving images on the server
----------------------------

**Advantages**

1.  A mail message without images generates less data traffic on
    reception.
2.  A mail message without images generates less data traffic on
    sending.
3.  The application uses the data traffic of picking images of the
    server to **register impressions**.

**Disadvantages**

1.  On repetitive opening of the same e-mail, there will be more data
    traffic (not really of your concern).
2.  On forwarding a mail message, there will be more data traffic (also
    not really of your concern).
3.  Certain organisations and people working offline will not be able to
    see/download the images (this argument was valid back in the 90s).
4.  Certain e-mail clients do not depict the images unless the recipient
    explicitely clicks a link to do so.

Embedding images
----------------

The average recipient won't notice if the images have been embedded or
not. And the e-mail will display to them completely as intended.

Embedding images turns them into a kind of attachment to your mailing.

**Advantages**

1.  People working offline or at certain shielded companies will still
    be able to see the images.
2.  Recipient will see the images instantly in the preview pane of his
    inbox and does not need to perform any extra action to view the
    e-mail as intended.

**Disadvantages**

1.  Embedding images generates more data traffic between the servers.
2.  Certain e-mail clients do not handle embedded images well, which
    effects your e-mail layout negatively.

Some e-mail clients see the images as attachments. They will not show
them in the e-mail, but only as downloadable items. Hotmail and Gmail
for example are known to make this 'error'. Outdated spam programs have
the same effect.

Summary
-------

The arguments above conclude a preference to leaving images behind on
the server, because:

-   The e-mail will be smaller in size.
-   Spam risk is slightly reduced.
-   Only with this method can impressions be registered by the software.
-   Email is more likely displayed as intended
-   Most pros for embedding are out of date and obsolete\
