In the _Content_ section of the software, you can create and manage articles. With these articles you can then compose feeds that are easily included in your e-mails, published on your website, or anywhere else on the web through RSS of Atom. These are standardized methods to distribute (unformatted) digital content.

The advantage of this way of working is that you manage content in one central place, and subsequently allowing you to distribute your content through an infinite number of channels. Feeds are dynamic. Readers of your feed automatically see the newest articles. That's why they're often called live feeds.

**Categories:**  To publish an article in a feed, the article should be placed in a category first. The available categories are shown in the left overview, labeled **Article categories**.

**Articles:**  A feed is a collection of articles. You can create unlimited categories, and put them into any category you created.

**Filters:** Which articles will be included in the feed, you specify with filters. Example, you can set filters to only include articles from a specific category or a specific author in your feed. You can also set how many articles should show up at once in the published feed, the order in which articles are placed and which articles should be included based on the age of the article.

### Publish your feed

To include your Content feed in an emailing or web page, just use the following code

`{loadfeed feed="http://vicinity.picsrv.net/feed/rss/000/"}`

(replace the link with the address of your feed)

Each feed has an RSS and an Atom version. These are by far the most common feed formats, and can be read by any feed reader that supports these formats (all modern feed readers can).

You can easily publish your feed in your blog (eg Blogger, Wordpress). You can also share the link with others so they can subscribe to the feed. For example, with Google Reader.
