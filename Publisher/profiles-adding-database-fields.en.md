first you have to create database fields.

-   Log in to Copernica Marketing Software and go to ‘Profiles’
-   Select the database you want to create fields for.

-   Choose ‘Add field’

Next you’ll have to enter the following information:

### Create in

The database you want to create a field for

### Name

The name you want to give the field. If you want to use the field to
store surnames for example, you fill in ‘Surname’.

-   **Textfield:** For saving text. Someone’s name for example. You have
    the option to limit the field to a maximum number of characters.
-   **Numeric field:** Use for saving numeric values, like amounts.
-   **Email field:** Field for entering email addresses.

    questions.

    from another database.

Also, you now have the option to check four other boxes:

in ‘Profiles’.
