When composing your survey you can choose from four question types: open
question, multiple choice, grid question or an in-between text (which is
of course not really a question).

This article is about the question types. [Were you looking for

**Each question has at least two options**

-   **Optional** - Check this box if the question may be skipped by the
    participant. Otherwise he/she will be obliged to fill in an answer
    before his/her survey can be submitted.
-   **Starts on new page** - Check this box if this question should
    start on a new web page. There will be a submit button added after
    the last question before this one, and those questions will not be
    shown again on the next page where this question starts.
-   **Display** (multiple choice only) - Choose checkboxes if multiple
    answers are allowed for this question. Choose selectbox to allow
    only one answer.

### Text between questions

Text between questions is given the same space as a question, but has no
answering option. It is mostly used to add introductory headers to
questions or divisions between topics.

### Open questions

An open question allows the participant to type in an answer through
free text.\
 After saving the question you will see the extra option to limit the
number of lines the participant will see to fill out his answer.

### Multiple-choice questions

A multiple choice question offers the participant a select number of
answering possibilities. After saving the question you will see several
options for these choices.\
\
 The multiple choice answers can be displayed as **select boxes**, which
will show a **drop down menu**with an arrow on the side, or as
**checkboxes**, which will display**little squares** that can be checked
or unchecked.

Choose also if the participant is allowed to give only one answer, or
multiple. Multiple answers only work with checkboxes. Select boxes are
more often used for one answer.\
\
 A separate tab is displayed to enter the answering options. Add, edit
and move around the answers. Use *'add additional text box'*for the
*'Other...'*option, so that the participant can fill out a textual
answer.

Multiple choice question with two option. The second one has an
additional text box for an open answer.

### Prefill / Checked option

To have one of the multiple choice options already checked for the
respondent, add a \* to that option (before or after text). The \* will
be visible in the text and the checkbox will already be checked.

### Grid questions

A grid offers the participant a table of answers. Usually this will be a
scaling of bad/good or 1 through 5. After saving the question extra
options are displayed.

-   Choose if the questions is horizontal or vertical.
-   A vertical lining means that only one answer from each column can be
    chosen. A horizontal lining is to choose answers per row (most
    common for scaling).
-   On a separate tab you may enter the answering options and variables.
    Add rows and columns. You may also change their order and/or
    position in the options.
