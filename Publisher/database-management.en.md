Each marketing campaign starts with a contact database. You manage your
database(s) in the Profiles section. A profile is a record in your
database, for example with data of a single relationship. Databases can
be extended with collections, for example you can store purchased
products.

You manage databases, collections and (sub) profile data in the section
**Profiles**.
