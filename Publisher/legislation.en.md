Privacy and the protection of personal details are very important for us
at Copernica Marketing Software. That's why we ask you to always be
careful and to ensure that all marketing activities you do, are done
according to the law. Below you'll find some tips you can use to collect
and process personal details in a legal way (Dutch legislation) during
your marketing activities.

As of the 1st of January, the new Code Email is enforced in the
Netherlands. This code will replace the already existing codes for
commercial emails to businesses and consumers and will be part of the
Advertising Code. What do you need to know about this code and what
rules do you have to follow? Learn more under the header Code Email.

### Personal details

Personal details are:

-   Every piece of information that contains data on a natural person
-   Information that makes a person identifiable

Think of phone numbers for example, name and address information, email
addresses, IP addresses, bank account numbers, photos or cookies (as far
as these can be tracked to a certain individual).

Information about companies or organizations generally aren't personal
details. So if your
[database](./creating-your-own-databases.en.md "Create your own databases")
only contains data on companies, these details aren't personal details.
Data on contact persons at these companies however, should be considered
as personal details.

### Processing personal details

You are processing personal details whenever you are performing actions
that apply to personal details: so whenever you have control over
personal details.

When processing personal details, this has to happen in a fair way. This
means the processing has to take place:

-   According to the law. Meaning that besides the Data Protection Act,
    you also have to consider other laws, like the legislation around
    telecommunications.
-   In a proper and careful manner.
-   For predetermined, explicitly explained and justified goals.
    Determine a clear and concrete goal you want to gather the personal
    details for.
-   When the person in question is effectively and fully informed about
    the circumstances the details are gathered in. Always be clear and
    inform proactively what will happen with the details!

Processing the details, among other reasons, may be done based on:

-   Unambiguous permission
-   Necessity for execution of an arrangement
-   Representation of legitimate interest, except if it's overruled by
    the interest of privacy

### Unambiguous permission

The first requirement to be able to process personal details is that you
have to have unambiguous permission. The person in question has to have
given permission voluntarily, that permission has to be given aimed at a
certain data processing and there should be no doubt about where the
given details are used for. If there is any doubt, this first has to be
taken away and you have to re-ask for permission.

### Executing and agreement

If you made an agreement with someone, you are allowed to use their
personal details as far as necessary to execute the agreement. You are
also allowed to use the personal details in the phase before the
agreement is executed, should this be necessary.

### Representation of a legitimate interest

You are allowed to use personal details when this is necessary for your
or a third party's legitimate interest, unless the interest or
fundamental rights of the concerned person are more important than that
legitimate interest. A legitimate interest has to always be described
concretely. Examples of legitimate interests:

-   Promoting sales
-   Advertising, also for a third party
-   Sharing information with a third party
-   Direct marketing

In the case of a legitimate interest like direct marketing, you are
allowed to process personal details without permission and without
executing an agreement, **BUT**:

-   To send emails or SMS text messages you always need permission =
    **opt-in**
-   With direct marketing activities you always need to offer the
    possibility to object = **opt-out**

Note: Personal details may not be processed in a way that is
incompatible with the goals they were obtained for. So sharing personal
details with a third party is only allowed if it fits the goals the
details were provided for.

### Duty to inform and opt-out

As responsible party you always have the duty to inform the concerned
party. Someone whose personal details are being processed, should always
be able to check where his or her details are being used for. Also,
someone always has the right to object to the processing of his or her
personal details.

The duty to inform means you have to inform someone about, inter alia:

-   Who you are (the identity of the responsible party)
-   For what purpose you're collecting and processing personal details
-   The concerned party's right to view and correct his or her personal
    details
-   The right to object

In the case of sharing details with a third party, you have to inform
the concerned party about:

-   The category the third party is part of
-   The right to object to the sharing of details with a third party

### Email marketing

Like mentioned before, for email marketing it's necessary that you
obtain an opt-in from your commercial and business relations. This means
you will have to get an opt-in for the following goals:

-   Commercial and charity goals
-   Newsletters
-   Press releases

You don't need an opt-in whenever you approach your own existing clients
for similar products and offers = soft opt-in. You do however have the
obligation to always offer an opt-out. You can use a soft opt-in when
you deploy email marketing:

-   Within your own company context
-   To an existing client relation
-   To sell an own product or service
-   Where the given information can be reasonably expected by the
    recipient

### Code email

As of the 1st of January, the new Code Email is enforced in the
Netherlands. This code will replace the already existing codes for
commercial emails to businesses and consumers and will be part of the
Advertising Code. According to the [DDMA](http://ddma.nl/ "DDMA"), as a
result of the new code, companies will communicate in a more transparent
way about their email marketing towards the consumer. The advertiser
will become more responsible and the recipient will be better protected.

But what does this code mean for users of Copernica? What do you have to
know and what rules should you follow?

-   Make sure you have permission for sending email. Are you using an
    address database from a third party? Make sure that the party you
    are receiving the addresses from (the data owner) has permission
    from the addressee to send advertisements. The principle of
    unambiguous permission still applies: the addressee must actively
    and consciously give permission. The addressee must also give the
    data owner explicit permission to share his or her email address
    with third parties.
-   For the addressee it has to be clear where his or her email address
    is used for. This may no longer be hidden somewhere in the Terms and
    Conditions or the Privacy Statement.
-   The soft opt-in is still allowed. You don't need prior permission
    when using email addresses to send similar products or services.
-   In a newsletter sign up, you have tell the addressee what he or she
    can expect. "Yes, I want to sign up for the newsletter" is no longer
    sufficient.
-   The Code requires the database owner or the advertiser to include
    his or her label (or company name) in the 'From field'. The
    addressee should always have the possibility to opt out at the party
    that has permission to send him or her advertisements. .
-   The addressee has to be able to opt-out at the level where he or she
    signed up. Example: a publisher has multiple products or titles and
    sends out commercial emails for all of them. The addressee then has
    the right to opt-out for all emails from that publisher at once. He
    or she doesn't have to opt-out for every product or title
    separately.
-   The 'reply to' field has to include a working address, a 'no reply'
    address is not allowed. There should always be a contact option for
    the addressee in the email.
-   In the case of 'Tell a friend' systems, the name of the friend that
    sends the message has to be in the 'from' field. This way the
    addressee has the option to directly answer his friend, and indicate
    if he or she wants to keep receiving these kind of emails.
-   In the Code an advice is included on the adding of attachments to
    emails. It's recommended to send none at all. Emails with
    attachments are blocked by spam filters more than average and
    contribute to a bad reputation of the email. If you want to send
    attachments anyway, always keep the file size below 150 kb.

### Tell a friend

Tell a friend is the option where someone can send an email to someone
he or she knows through a website, without prior permission. In a lot of
cases, this is an important part of viral marketing. The CBP and OPTA
decided that tell a friend is allowed, as long as the following
requirements are met:

-   The sharing is initiated by the internet user on his or her own
    initiative. The website may not offer a reward or a chance to win a
    prize in return, for as well the sender as the recipient.
-   For the recipient, it should be perfectly clear who initiated the
    email, giving him or her the chance to approach this party and
    indicate if he or she wants to keep receiving these kind of emails.
-   The sender has to be able to get a full preview of the message
    that's sent on his or her behalf, offering the chance to take full
    responsibility for the personal contents of the message.
-   The concerned website is not allowed to use the email addresses and
    other personal details for any other goal than to send a message on
    behalf of the sender. The website is also required to secure the
    system against abuse, such usage by spam bots.

According to the Email Code, tell a friend has to meet the following
additional requirements:

-   Personal relation of addressee is allowed to send advertisements
    without prior permission.
-   The name of the personal relation has to be included in the 'from'
    field.
-   The sender has to be able to get a full preview of the message
    before its sent.
-   A reply by the recipient should be sent directly to the personal
    relation's mailbox. The email address of the personal relation
    should be in the 'reply to' field.
-   Using email addresses and other personal details for other purposes
    is only allowed if advertiser has explicit permission from the
    person concerned to do so.
-   Harvesting is forbidden. It's not permitted to store entered
    addresses in the commercial database.
