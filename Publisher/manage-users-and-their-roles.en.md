Every account has users. How users are billed depends on your your
license type (see your [License
Details](https://www.copernica.com/en/userprofile/) online for the
pricing associated with your license).

An account has at least 1 user. There is no limit to the number of users
within an account.

This article is about users and user management in the marketing
software itself, which (for a large part) stands apart from user
management and roles on Copernica.com.

The first user account automatically becomes an account administrator.
The administrator can perform certain tasks such as adding and deleting
other users, and setting the individual access rights.

### Add user

Administrators within an account are able to add and remove users. To
add a user, go to the **Admin**section. In the **User**menu, choose
**Add user**.

To add a user, you need his or her email address.

Enter the email address of the new user and then click on *submit*. You
can also pick a user from the list of suggestions.

*A user is in the list of suggestions, when he is already a user within
one of the accounts that you also have access to. Thus you will only see
users that you (probably) already know.*

### Same user in different accounts

If you have access to multiple accounts, you use the same credentials to
access these accounts. If you have access to both**Account
A** and **Account B**, you are asked which account you wish to access
right after loggin in.

Once you're logged into an account, you may wish to switch to your other
accounts via the personal menu in the top-right corner (*Welcome
name*...). Click on **Switch account**to choose a different account.

Edit access rights
------------------

For each user can be set individually what role he or she has within the
account. In Copernica, we distinguish between four different roles.\
 \
 Only an administrator can change the access rights of others. An
administrator cannot revoke his or her own access rights.

#### User is account administrator

An administrator has the most rights. Every account has at least 1
administrator. A single account can have multiple administrators.

-   An administrator can add and remove users
-   An administrator can manage the individual rights of other users
    within the account.
-   An administrator can configure the delivery settings of an account
    (delivery limit, pic server domain, etc.)
-   An administrator is also style administrator. See below.
-   An administrator is allowed to create new accounts and delete
    accounts

#### User is style administrator

The style administrator is the patron of the content within an account.
He or she may for example modify templates, but can also determine which
documents may be sent in a bulk mailing and by whom. The style
administrator can give other (normal) users the right to create, use, or
delete templates, style sheets and other publications. \
 \
 A style administrator is not allowed to perform 'real' administrative
tasks such as removing and adding users.

#### User has access to the API

If you want to make use of the SOAP API, you must create a separate user
to establish the connection (with a unique email address). If you give
the user access to the API, and disable access to the user interface,
then this user is not billed (the API user is free of charge).

#### User has access to the user interface

This is a normal end-user of the software. Per publication is indicated
(by the application admin or style administrator) whether he or she may
use the publication or not (via **Access rights**in the menu of the
template / document / ... / web page).

### Access rights are set per account

A user with access to multiple accounts may have different roles in
these accounts. The user can have the role of administrator in account A
and the role of a normal user in account B.

### Remove or add users

Administrators can add and remove users to an account. The first two
users in an account are free of charge.

### Adding partner users

If you use the services of one of the registered Copernica partners,
then you can give them access to your account at no additional costs.
For this you go through the same steps as for adding normal users.\
 \
 The partner gets the same user rights any new user automatically gets.
As an application admin, you can revoke the access rights of the partner
user if desired. \
 \
 To edit the access rights, select the partner user, and then choose
**Set Access Permissions** in the lower toolbar.

### Deactivate users (temporarily)

There are two different ways to deactivate users

1.  A user can be deactivated temporarily by unchecking all the access
    rights of the user. The user will still be charged.
2.  Another way is to (temporarily) remove the user. A user is only
    billed for the period that he or she is active within the account.
    You can rehabilitate the user at any time by again adding the user
    to the account. No data will get lost after removing a user.

### Individual user statistics

Of each user we keep track of the number of emails, text messages, API
calls, etc. initiated by the user. This information always remains
accessible from the tab 'Consumption in account [account name]'. Even
after a user has been removed.
