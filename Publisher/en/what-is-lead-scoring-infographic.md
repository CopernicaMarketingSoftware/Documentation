Lead scoring originates from the need of being as relevant as possible.
Until now, most companies have only been focusing on collecting personal
data from their clients and using this to add a sense of relevancy to
their campaigns.

However valuable, personal data as such tell nothing about someone’s
likeliness to buy or engagement with your brand and therefore are
inadequate for the real touch of relevancy.

Information about someone’s behavior, like page visits, opens, clicks
and likes, and even filtered data like recency, frequency and monetary
value, add the personal touch.

The disadvantage of behavioral data can be that they are too general to
use for personalization purposes. The solution to this is to apply lead
scoring to the soft data of an individual.

Lead scoring is a methodology used to rank prospects against a scale
that represents the perceived value each lead represents to the
organization.

By adding scores to predefined common behavior, like pages visited,
forms submitted, social likes, recency, frequency and monetary value,
(type of ) information requested, an individual relation is rewarded
with a score.

The score ranks the relation, triggering interactions, like lead
nurturing campaigns or calls from sales representatives.

Throughout the customer life cycle you could identify various types of
lead scores. E.g. for prospects this could be a distinction between
Marketing qualified leads (MQL) or Sales qualified leads (SQL). For
clients this could be a distinction between engaged and non-engaged
clients.

To specify the latter: For example a company that sells shoes, applied
the following lead scoring:

-   Purchase of a pair of shoes: + 20
-   Purchase of accessories (shoe polish, laces, soles): + 5
-   Monetary value in last year \> \$250: +30
-   Monetary value in last year \< \$25: -20
-   No purchase in last 6 months: - 15
-   Create account on website: +10

-   Like on Facebook: + 5
-   Visit homepage: + 10
-   Open of a newsletter: + 1
-   Click on a link: + 10
-   Share to social: + 15
-   Unsubscribe: -25
-   Bounce of an email: - 30
-   No open in last three months: - 10
-   No click in last 6 months: - 15
-   Etc.

Anyone with a positive score is engaged, with the ones with a score of
over 45 are the true brand ambassadors. Anyone with a negative score is
labeled as non-engaged. For all three segments different marketing
tactics apply.

Personal data are useful for personalization, but don’t provide true
understanding of an individual’s ‘likeliness to buy’. By using lead
scoring as an instrument of targeting relations based on behavior, you
will be able to be timely and relevant, with more conversion as a
reward.
