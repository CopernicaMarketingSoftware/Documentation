The software allows you to store files at profiles in your database.
These files can be uploaded by a profile himself (via a web form with an
upload field), or they can be manually added to the profile by you or
other users of your account.

To lookup and manage these files at the profile, go to the profile, and
then click the tab **Files**.

### Directory structure

You are free to create a directory structure. First, create a directory
structure by clicking the Add directory. Then you can upload files from
your computer. If you want to change the name of the directory you use
the Edit directory button.

At each file you can see who has uploaded it .

### Copy directory structure

It is possible to copy the directory structure of a single profile to
all other profiles or to a specific profile. For this, use the function
**Copy structure.**

### Upload files using a web form

It is possible to add an upload field to your Content web forms. This
ebables your visitors to upload their own files to their profiles.
