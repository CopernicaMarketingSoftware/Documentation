# Campaign tutorial: Double opt-in

A commercial email sender is only allowed to send email to addresses that 
have given their explicit permission to receive this mail: This is known 
as an opt-in. This also means you are not allowed to buy a list of email 
addresses or scrape them from the web yourself. When someone signs up for 
your newsletter or emails about promotions this is known as a single opt-in.

However, the best thing for your reputation is to always use a double opt-in. 
A double opt-in confirms that a user really wants to receive your email 
by confirming their subscription, usually in the form of clicking a 
confirmation link sent to them by email.
