It is possible to use smarty code in your content webforms

You can use personalization code in:

-   Web form field labels
-   Web form field default values
-   The web form submit button text
-   Within a web form text block

If the web form is visited by a profile or subprofile that is logged in,
the web form can be personalized with data from this person.

If the web form visitor is anonymous, you can still use smarty functions
like the smarty.now date function. To store the date of completion in
the profile through a hidden field, for instance.

**Note:**The functions
[linkfile](./the-loadfile-and-linkfile-functions.md)
and
[loadfile](./the-loadfile-and-linkfile-functions.md)
can only be used in e-mailings or websites.
