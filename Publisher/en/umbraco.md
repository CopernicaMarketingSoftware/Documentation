About Umbraco
-------------

This Umbraco integration has been built to integrate with the Umbraco
CMS. It adds functionality to synchronize and export members
automatically to Copernica for marketing purposes. Managing the plug-in
settings can be done from within the CMS, as the plug-in adds a new
section to the Umbraco back-office.

The download file contains a downloadable package and the user manual.
Your Umbraco members can be uploaded to Copernica within 10 minutes!

The connection consists of two components:

-   A settings screen where the user can manage their Copernica settings
-   A dashboard with some status information about the plug-in

You can install the downloadable package in Umbraco. This package is
available for free for everyone. However, when downloading the package,
the source code will not be released. To obtain the source code, you
will have to contact Arlanet (developer of the integration). You can do
this by sending an email to support@arlanet.com or calling +31
(0)75-6476090.
