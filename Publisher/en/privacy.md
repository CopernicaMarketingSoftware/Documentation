# Privacy

Privacy is an important topic in the digital world we live in, because 
everyone relies on technology that collects more data about us every day. 
Managing the data of your customers well is important to the trustworthiness 
of your company, so Copernica wants to make this as easy as possible for you.

## GDPR

The GDPR, or General Data Protection Regulation, protects the data of citizens 
of the European Union. It gives individuals a right to know what personal 
data is stored on them and to access and correct this data. According to the 
regulation all data stored should be relevant to the goal of the organization 
storing it and data that has become irrelevant should be deleted in a timely 
manner. As a customer of Copernica you have to comply with these regulations.
