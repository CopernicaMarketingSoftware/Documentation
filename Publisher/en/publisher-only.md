# Publisher only functions

Copernica has two online marketing tools: The Publisher and the Marketing 
Suite. The Marketing Suite is newer and still under construction, so 
there are a few functions from Publisher that are not available to MS users 
yet. However, by switching to Publisher in the Marketing Suite you can 
still use these functionalities. The following features are only available 
for Publisher at the moment:

* [SMS mailings](./compose-sms-message)
* [Surveys](./surveys)
* [Websites](./websites)
* [Webforms](./web-forms)
* [CSS and XSLT](./css-and-xslt)
* [RSS and ATOM feeds](./rss-and-atom-feeds)
