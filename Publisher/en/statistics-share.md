# Statistics: Sharing with Marketing Suite

You can share the results of your emailing campaigns with colleagues,
friends, or anyone else that you would like to inform about your recent
online marketing successes, without needing to give them login
credentials.

The document contains information about the **destinations**,
**impressions**, **clicks** and **errors** registered for your
**mailing**, **scheduled mailings** or **split run mailing**.

You can create as many shared documents as you want and share it to the
whole world if you like. There are no charges involved!

## Create a report

Go to **Mailing history** and select your mailing or template. Go to the **Options** 
tab and view the mailing/template statistics. Click the **Share statistics** 
button on the top right of the screen. In the dialog that
appears you can enter a title for the document and an expiration date.
After the document expires, it will not be available anymore.

You can also send the hyperlink directly by selecting the "generate URL 
and send it directly by email" option. Simply enter the recipients, 
separated by commas, the subject and an optional additional message.

The shared statistics document is a live document. That is, you can
create the document right after you have sent out your email campaign or
newsletter. The charts and numbers in the document will always be up to
date\* when you open or refresh the web page.

**Note:**To prevent server overload, statistics can walk behind with the
displaying of errors and impressions.

## Who can view / recieve the document

Anyone can open the document. The document is not indexed by any search
engine or other crawlers.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### I only want to share the clicks, not the impressions. Can I compose my own document?

It is currently not possible to compose your own document. This might
become available in a future release though.

#### Is it possible for the receiver of a document to change its language?

This is currently not possible. The document language is the same as the
application language that is currently used by the supplier of the
document. That is, when the supplier switches the application language
to German, the language used in the shared document will also switch to
German.

#### In the shared document about my account email statistics, I noticed that the number of errors in the waterfall does not seem to correspondent with the total count of the number of errors in the detailed overview of the errors. How come?

The number of errors displayed in the waterfall is the number of
destinations where an error was or multiple errors were registered. The
detailed overview however shows all the errors registered (and what kind
of errors they were). More than one error can be registered for one
destination. For instance, the receiving mail server can be
non-responsive during a first delivery attempt and rejecting the email
at the second attempt, resulting in 2 errors total. If the third attempt
was successful and click was registered, the 2 errors registered will
still be in the detailed overview, but the destination will be moved to
the clicks in the chart with the dominant results.

#### In the share statistics document the numbers seem to be incorrect. In the text it says there have been X impressions, but the waterfall chart below indicates that there have been Y impressions. How come?

The number of impressions in the text are total impressions. For
example, if someone opens an email twice (on his office computer first
and later on his smart phone on his way back home) two impressions are
registered and counted.

However the impressions in the waterfall chart are the destinations that
only have an impression as the dominant result and are only counted
once. That is, even if someone registered two impressions.

When a destination also clicks on a hyperlink, he will move from
destinations to the clicks in the waterfall chart.
