# Surveys: Edit survey questions

Survey questions can be edited, removed, copied and moved. To do so, you
can use the so-called functions in the toolbar below the survey.

## Remove a question

First select the question you wish to remove, then choose the "delete"
function in the menu 'Survey'. Be careful, this deletes the question forever!

## Add/edit a question

Select the "New question" or "Edit" button from the survey menu. You can 
now add or edit a question the same way you would when initially creating 
the survey. See the documentation on question [types](./surveys-question-types) and 
[options](./surveys-question-options).

## Copy a question

Select the question youâ€™d like to copy and press the "Copy"
button from the bottom toolbar.

In the dialog window that appears, you can choose the copy target. Press
Copy to start the copy process. If you have a media library attached to 
the original survey, you may copy the library along to the other survey 
and even a different account.

## Move a question

Select the question that you would like to move and choose "Move". Enter 
the new position and the question will be moved.
