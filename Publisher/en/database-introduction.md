# Database management

Copernica databases are fully configurable and fit all your information needs. 
You can choose how you store your information and [import](./database-import) 
and [export](database-export) everything with ease.

Copernica databases can be layered, allowing you to do things like store 
purchase histories. It's also possible to make [selections](./selections-introduction) 
for segmentation and personalization. Copernica stores a lot of information 
like clicks, opens, bounces and errors as well, which can help you create 
more succesful campaigns in the future.

Although some Copernica users choose to regularly create new databases and
upload new profile data, we always advise to update your current database. 
Since Copernica stores so much feedback from campaigns you miss out on a lot 
of inofmration otherwise!

## Multiple dimensions

When working with Copernica software you will run into the terms *collection*
and *subprofile* very often. A database becomes multidimensional when 
you would start storing *collections* within your database, like the 
purchase history for a customer. In this case we would refer to the customer 
as the *profile* and to the order as the *subprofile*.

You could apply the same principle by storing a company's employees in 
a collection, or a parent's children.

## Things to consider

The most important thing to consider in your database is the structure. 
You want your database to be clear and effective. It's also possible to 
install rules and restrictions to prevent invalid data from entering your 
system or sending out unintended mailings.
