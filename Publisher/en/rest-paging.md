# REST API: paging

Many REST methods, e.g. the method to [fetch databases](rest-get-databases)
and the method to [fetch profiles](rest-get-profile), return lists of objects.
In order to reduce the amount of time a REST API call takes and to prevent a
single call from overtaxing our API servers, the output of these methods is
restricted. Each call returns at most 100 objects, even if there are more.
Retrieving all objects might require multiple calls.

## Returned data

Whenever a method returns a list of objects, this list is always wrapped in a JSON object.
This object has a number of properties that can be used to determine whether
the list is complete or whether the output was limited and more entries are available.

    {
        "start":    50,
        "limit":    100,
        "count":    100,
        "total":    335,
        "data":     [ .... ]
    }

The most important property is *data*, which contains an array with the requested objects;
e.g. an array of databases or an array of profiles.
The other properties contain numerical values that indicate how many objects were returned
and how many are available.

The property *start* is the numerical identifier from which to start the list,
and the *limit* property states the maximum number of objects to be returned.
The *count* property contains the number of objects actually returned.
In the above example, 100 objects were returned whose identifiers range from 50 to 149.

The property *total* contains the total number of available objects.
In the above example the total is 335, which means it takes at least 4 calls
to retrieve all of the objects.

## Paging parameters

Every method that returns a list of objects supports three default parameters:
*start*, *limit* and *total*. The *start* and *limit* are numerical parameters
that can be used to declare which part of the list you want to retrieve:
how many objects to skip from the start of the list,
and how many items to retrieve.

The *total* parameter is a boolean parameter that can be set to false to
indicate that you are not interested in the total number of available objects.
For large collections, enumerating all the objects is a relatively heavy operation.
Unless your application needs access to the *total* property in the returned JSON,
it is better to indicate that this property is not needed in order to speed up the API call.

# PHP example

The following example demonstrates how to retrieve only the second set of five items from a list of databases.

    // required code
    require_once('copernica_rest_api.php');
    
    // change this into your access token
    $api = new CopernicaRestAPI("your-access-token", 2);
    
    // parameters to be passed to the api
    $parameters = array(
        'start'             =>  5,
        'limit'             =>  5,
        'total'             =>  false
    );
    
    // fetch and print the databases
    print_r($api->get("databases", $parameters));

You need the [CopernicaRestApi class](rest-php) to run the example.
