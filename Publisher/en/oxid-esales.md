About OXID eSales
-----------------

This integration automatically synchronizes all customer data, such as
orders, ordered products and abandoned shopping carts, between OXID and
your Copernica database. This way all your data is constantly up to
date. Price changes, user groups and newsletter subscriptions are also
synchronized.

The OXID integration is also compatible with the [OXID Enterprise
Edition](http://www.oxid-esales.com/en/products/facts/oxid-eshop-enterprise-edition/product-information.html).
A Copernica license is required to use this integration
