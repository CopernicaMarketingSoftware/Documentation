# Styling in Publisher

Publisher allows you to customize the look of webforms, surveys and 
feeds through [CSS](./css) and [XSLT](./xslt). Stylesheets for both can 
be created under the **Style** component in the Publisher.

Both options also offer a default styling sheet to help you get started. 
Clear comments indicate what each line of code does, making it easy to 
start editing to create a style that reflects your corporate identity.

## CSS

With [CSS](./css) stylesheets you can change the look and feel of your HTML document. 
Possibilities include changing the color and size of your font, changing 
the background color and adding borders to elements.

CSS is a widely used technology, which means there are many resources 
available to teach you everything you need to know. Therefore our documentation 
will not discuss the syntax or give you tutorials, but teach you how to use 
it within our platform. Resources for learning CSS include [Mozilla's 
introduction to CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS) 
or [this tutorial from tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/css/).

## XSLT

Using XSLT you can convert XML files to HTML source code. By creating a 
custom XSLT style you can define how to style this HTML code. 
Titles for examples, can be placed within `<h1>` tags and paragraphs within 
`<p>` tags.

While XSLT offers many possibilities, it is also complex and requires more 
specific knowledge compared to CSS. XSLT, just like CSS, is a widely used 
technology and there are many resources available, like 
[this tutorial from w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xsl_intro.asp) 
or [this tutorial from tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/xslt/). 
Within this documentation we only discuss the application of this technology 
within our software. We also offer a few tips and tricks pertaining to this 
tricky language.
