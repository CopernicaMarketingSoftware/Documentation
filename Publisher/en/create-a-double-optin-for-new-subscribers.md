# Publisher Tutorial: Creating a double opt-in for new profiles

According to the law you are not allowed to drive through a red traffic 
light, but you are also not allowed to send commercial email to people 
who did not register for it. Such a registration is dubbed an "opt-in" 
in the internet marketing world. When you unsubscribe this is called an 
"opt-out". A double opt-in asks the user to confirm their email so you 
can guarantee your users registered a valid email address, which also 
improves your [deliverability](./deliverability).

Note: This is an older tutorial aimed at Publisher users. If you use 
Marketing Suite you should use [this tutorial](./campaign-tutorials-double-opt-in) 
instead.

## How does it work?

A new user would like to receive a periodic newsletter. They register 
with an email address. An automatic mail is sent to the user with a link 
they have to click to confirm their registration. The registration is 
completed on clicking the link, before that time the user will not receive 
any of your mailings.

The double optin has a few important advantages compared to the simple 
optin:
- The person registering for the mailings is the same person as the one 
that receives them.
- The address you send your mail to is guaranteed to be valid, reducing 
the amount of errors when sending a mailing.
- Because there are less errors your *deliverability* is better.
- The database is cleaner, because it only contains people who can and 
want to receive your newsletters.

### Configuring a double optin

1.  A new users registers with your registration form.
2.  When the form is sent an automatic mail is sent to the user containing 
the confirmation link. This will be accomplished with a follow-up link.
3.  When this link is clicked the subscription is confirmed.
4.  Optionally send another confirmation mail with information about 
    how to unsubscribe and some interesting product on your website.

### Requirements

- You will need a database with a multiple choice field for newsletter preference 
and a field for the email address of the profile.
-   Three web pages:
    -   Registration page (1)
    -   Registration completion page where you inform the user about the 
    email they have received. (2)
    -   The page the user will be sent to after completing registration by 
    clicking the link. You can include some useful information, tips or 
    products too!
        (3)
-   An email document to send to contain the hyperlink.

## Step 1: Preparing the database

Your database needs at least a field containing the profile's email and 
a newsletter preference field. Please note that there is a special type 
for the [e-mail field](./database-fields-and-collections) that 
should be user in order for our system to recognize it.

The field for newsletter preference should contain at least the following 
options:

-   [empty option]
-   No
-   Yes, unconfirmed
-   Yes, confirmed

You may also provide the user with the option to choose how often they 
want to receive a letter. In that case you should add more options to 
your registration form and update this field accordingly.

## Step 2: Prepare your webpages

Create your webpages so you can display the registration form and inform 
your clients.

## Step 3. Preparing the form

In this step we create the registration form with two fields:

1.  A **text field** linked to the email in the database.
2.  An **invisible field** that is linked to the field with the newsletter 
preference. By default it is set to "Yes, unconfirmed" when the user sends 
the form.

Note: Since the automatic email should be sent to the user of the form 
you should use the "Login as profile from database" setting that you 
can find under the form settings.

Now place the form on the first webpage you made and make the following page 
the notice that the automatic email was sent. You can display their email 
address with `{$emailaddress}`.

## Step 4: Configure a followup action to the form.

When the form is completed and sent a confirmation mail should arrive in 
the users mailbox. We accomplish this with a [followup action](./follow-up-manager).

Go to the **Follow-ups** option in the webform menu and make a new followup 
that sends the email to the profile. Select the email document with the 
confirmation link.

## Step 5: Create the confirmation mail

Create a new mail document or edit an existing document. The most 
important thing is to add a hyperlink that refers to the "registration complete" 
webpage. We are now adding a followup to the hyperlink.

Go to the document menu and click on **Follow-ups**. Add a new followup 
and set it to change a field in the database. This value should be "Yes, confirmed" 
for the newsletter preference field.

Save the followup action. When the new user clicks the hyperlink their 
information the database will change and they will start to receive 
newsletters from you.

## Create a newsletter selection

In this step we will create a new selection to email only the profiles 
in our database that registered to receive mail. You can make a new selection 
under **Profiles** > **Database management** > **Edit selections**. Enter 
a name and a description and select "Check on field". Pick the newsletter 
preference field for the *field* option and enter the *value* "Yes, confirmed". 
You should then send your emails only to the selection you have created.
