# REST API: GET logfiles names

Copernica keeps logfiles about several things such as clicks, opens, errors, 
accepted messages, etc. These logfiles can be downloaded with the API.
By sending an HTTP GET request to the following URL you will get a list of
all log files for a particular date.

`https://api.copernica.com/v1/logfiles/$date?access_token=xxxx`

where `$date` is the date for which you want to see the logfiles.

## PHP Example

The following PHP script demonstrates how to use the API method:

    // dependencies
    require_once('copernica_rest_api.php');
    
    // change this into your access token
    $api = new CopernicaRestApi("your-access-token");

    // do the call, and print result
    print_r($api->get("logfiles/2017-02-12"));

For the example above you need the [CopernicaRestApi class](./rest-php.md).
