# Surveys: Publishing on your website

You can only publish surveys on webpages you have create in the **Websites**.
To publish it on one of your websites you use the following special tag:

`[survey name='surveyname']`

This is a survey with custom XSLT. XSLT is used to transform XML 
into a document recognized by a browser, such as HTML. If you want to 
add your own XSLT you should add the extra option "xslt=<name>", this way you 
can completely control the appearance of the survey. You can create an XSLT 
under **Style** in the marketing software and use the name in the XSLT option.
(See [stylesheets](./stylesheets))

A survey can only be published on a webpage. See the documentation 
on [how to create a webpage](./websites).
It is not possible to publish a survey in an email. When you link to a survey 
and it is completed, however, the given answers will automatically be linked 
to the profile the email was sent to.
