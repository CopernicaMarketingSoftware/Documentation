# Surveys: Publishing on your website

You can only publish surveys on webpages you have create in the **Websites**.
To publish you use the following special tag:

`[survey name='surveyname']`

A survey can only be published on a webpage. See the documentation 
on [how to create a webpage](./create-and-publish-your-own-web-pages.md).
It is not possible to publish a survey in an email. When you link to a survey 
and it is completed, however, the given answers will automatically be linked 
to the profile the email was sent to.
