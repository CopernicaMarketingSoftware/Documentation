By linking your Magento webshop to Copernica Marketing Software, you
will be able to create professional email campaigns and automate email
marketing throughout the customer journey. The integration automatically
synchronizes all relevant data from your webshop to Copernica, including
customer data, products viewed in the shop, shopping basket data, orders
and newsletter subscriptions.
