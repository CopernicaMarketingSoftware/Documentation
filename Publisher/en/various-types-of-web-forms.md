Create your own web forms with Copernica and publish them directly to
your website. By using web forms, your contacts will be able to easily
sign up for your newsletter or create an account for your online store.
Connect your web form to Copernica and store completed contact data in
your own Copernica
[database](./creating-your-own-databases.md "Creating your own databases").

What type of web form do you want to create?
--------------------------------------------

![What type of web form do you want to

The type of web form you need to create, depends on the goals you want
to achieve. In Copernica you can create various types of web forms to
enrich your
[database](./creating-your-own-databases.md "Creating your own databases").

Think of:

### Sign up form or information request

Compose a web form that a contact can use to request a brochure or to
sign up for your monthly newsletter.

### Login form

Create a login form for contacts that have an account or own area within
your website.

### 'Edit information' form

Create a from that enables contacts to edit their personal information.
These updates will automatically be synchronised with your database.

### Unsubscribe form

You are required by
[law](./legislation.md "Legislation") to
offer recipients the option to unsubscribe. An unsubscribe form is a
form of double opt-out, meaning that the contact has the choice to fully
unsubscribe, or just reduce the number of
[emails](./emailings.md "Emailings")Â that
they receive.

A working web form in just a few steps
--------------------------------------

In Copernica's editor, a working web form is just a few easy steps away:

-   Determine what information you need from a contact. Tip: only
    request the most necessary information. Asking for too much
    information willl discourage people from filling out the form.
-   Connect the form to the database in which you want to store the
    information.
-   Add the different fields to your web form. You have the possibility
    to add various types of fields, such as email, password and date.
    The software will check if someone entered the correct information.
-   Optionally, add a style to the form. You can do so by connecting a
    CSS or XSLT document to your web form.
-   Publish your form and connect the form to a [web
    page](http://www.copernica.com/en/features/web-pages "Web pages")
    you create in Copernica.
