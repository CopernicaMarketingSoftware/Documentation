Selections and miniselections
Apart from fields and collections, Copernica also has selections and miniselections. Selections are used to make segments in your database based on one or multiple conditions. This makes it possible to create specific targets for mailings and gives the user more insight in what's going on in their databases. Examples of useful selections are the birthday selection, the newsletter mailing list and people that shouldn't receive mail from you. The contents of selections are automatically updated as databases and selections are rebuilt multiple times a day.

Miniselections are similar to selections, only they exist at collection level and consist of subprofiles. (Mini)selections can be added, deleted and managed under *Profiles* >*Database management* > *Manage selections* in Publisher. In MarketingSuite, you find the *Create selection* button on the top right when viewing your database.

## Subselections
A subselection is a selection within a selection, so it's on a deeper level than a selection. Profiles in subselections need to comply to the rules of the parent selection as well as those of the subselection. Creating subselections is only possible on profile level; making subminiselections is not possible. Subselections are created the same way selections are.

## Selection rules
All profile data you store in Copernica can be used as rules for your selections. Selection rules can be made based on:

* **Field value**. Example: make a selection to check whether the field 'city' matches 'Amsterdam'. If it does, the profile will apear in the selection.
* **Interest**. Example: make a selection and check whether the profile has the interest 'Apple'. Everyone who likes Apple products will appear in the selection.
* **Date**. Example: Make a selection of all profiles whose warranty is expiring by setting the date to x months from the purchase date.
* **Campaign results**. There are multiple options to filter on campaign results: e-mail, sms, fax and survey results. Example: make a selection of all profiles that clicked a hyperlink in your last mailing.
* **Contact history**. Example: filter profiles based on whether or not you've had contact with them in the past x amount of time. 
* **Contents of a different (mini)selection**. Example: make a selection of people you haven't had contact with in the past six months and set as a second condition that they exist in the collection of Apple-interested profiles. That way, you have a selection to send a special mailing offering them a discount on Apple products to win them back.
* **Profile changes**. There are many different options for profile changes. Example: Checking if the field 'city' changed in the past month gives you a selection of people who recently moved.
* **Previous exports**. Use this to select profiles that have been exported between two points in time.

It's also possible to use selections to alphanumerically sort a given amount of profiles. Read [here]() how to to this.
