# Statistics in Publisher

The Copernica server save information about your mailings and your users. 
This information can be displayed in the Publisher application. Examples 
of statistics are the number of opens from your mailing and how many new 
profiles were created. You can [export statistics in Publisher](./statistics-export) 
or [export with the REST API](./rest-get-logfiles-names).

## Individual mailing/template statistics

Under the *E-mailings* menu you can find your templates and documents, which 
have their own statistics. From here you can access a complete report 
about your [mailing](./statistics-mailing) or [all mailings for a template](./statistics-template).

## Mobile mailings

It's possible to send text messages via Publisher, but the only available 
information here is whether or not these messages have arrived. [This article](statistics-mobile-mailing) 
contains more information about the limited statistics of the mobile mailing.

## Account mailing statistics

To keep track of the total of all mailings from your account you can 
view the overall statistics of your mailing. [This article](./statistics-account-mailings) 
explains the overall mailing statistics.

## Account statistics

The account statistics provide information about the usage of the account. 
[This article](./statistics-account) explains more about the account statistics. 
It is not possible to export this information currently.

## Webpage statistics

If you have a Copernica webpage the behaviour is tracked automatically. 
To learn more about these statistics you can read the article about it 
[here](./statistics-webpage)

## Key figures over a period of time

The *Profiles* menu has a tab called *statistics* where you can find more 
information about one or several mailings. It contains some graphs and 
[key figures](./statistics-key-figures). You can see your statistics in 
general or for specific periods of time here.

## Share statistics

With Marketing Suite you can share the results of your emailing campaigns with colleagues, 
friends, or anyone else that you would like to inform about your recent 
online marketing successes, without needing to give them login credentials. 
See [this article](./statistics-share) on sharing statistics.
