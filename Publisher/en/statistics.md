# Statistics in Publisher

The Copernica server save information about your mailings and your users. 
This information can be displayed in the Publisher application. Examples 
of statistics are the number of opens from your mailing and how many new 
profiles were created.

## Individual mailing statistics
Under the *Mailings* menu you can find a tab called statistics. From here 
you can access a complete report about your mailing. [This article](./view-the-results-of-your-mailing) 
explains in more detail what information is available and what it means.

## Key figures over a period of time
The *Profiles* menu has a tab called *statistics* where you can find more 
information about one or several mailings. It contains some graphs and 
[key figures](./statistics-key-figures). You can see your statistics in 
general or for specific periods of time here.

## Mobile mailings
It's possible to send text messages via Publisher, but the only available 
information here is whether or not these messages have arrived. [This article](viewing-the-results-of-a-mobile-mailing) 
contains more information about the limited statistics of the mobile mailing.
