SMS messages are easily composed.

To create a new SMS message, find the so called option in the menu
**Document** in the section **Mobile**of the software.

-   Give the document a descriptive **name** and optionally
    **description**. Only letters and digits are allowed in this field.
    The first character can not be a digit.
-   Choose the version of smarty you want to use for personalization in
    the message. We recommend to use [Smarty
    3](./smarty-2-vs-smarty-3.md).

Immediately after you have created the document you can start writing
its content.

In principle, a text message accepts up to 160 characters. In the bottom
of the screen you can see how many characters the message currently has.

### Caution: smarty personalization

You can use [Smarty
code](https://www.copernica.com/en/support/personalize-campaigns) to
personalize the message. You should however take into account the
maximum of 160 characters. With names like **Hubert Blaine
Wolfeschlegelsteinhausenbergerdorff**, you could easily exceed the
maximum number of characters. To see your message displayed with data
from the test destination, check the option *Personalized* in the bottom
of the screen.

#### Split large messages

You can choose to have your messages automatically split into multiple
messages if more than 160 characters are used in the message.

### Setting the message sender\

This it the *name* or *number*that the recipient will see as the sender
of the text message. You set the sender name or number of a message via
*Mobile \> Document \>***Sender ...**

Smarty personalization is allowed in this field.
