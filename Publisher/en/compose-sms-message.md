# Mobile messages in Publisher

Copernica can also send SMS messages for you. Even international campaigns 
are possibly without extra charges. They are also very easy to compose. 
You can find them in the **Mobile** tab of the Publisher application.

## Create a message

First give the document a descriptive name and (optionally) a description. 
Then choose the version of [Smarty](./smarty-2-vs-smarty-3.md) for 
[personalization](./personalization).

You can now immediately write content and personalize your message. A text 
message can be up to 160 characters long. If your message is longer you 
can choose to split it into multiple messages. Be especially careful 
when you use personalization, because values like names can be longer than 
you expect.

You also have to set the message sender, which is what the recipient will 
see when receiving the message. Set it under the *document* menu. Smarty 
personalization is also allowed in this field.
