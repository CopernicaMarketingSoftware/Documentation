Mobile messages are only invoiced when there was an attempt to deliver
the message. If there is some kind of value present in the mobile field,
we will do an attempt to deliver the message.

Suppose you have sent a mailing to a selection with 2000 recipients.
Only 1500 of them had a valid mobile number or some other value in the
field. You will be invoiced for 1500 messages a 10 euro cent per
message.

### International mobile campaigns

There are no additional costs for sending mobile messages to other
countries.
