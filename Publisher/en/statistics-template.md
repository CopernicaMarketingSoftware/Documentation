## Statistics: Template statistics

The template statistics shows you the results of a single template.

A single template can be used for different mailings. The template
statistics shows you the **cumulative results**Â of all mailings sent with
documents based on the template.

The statistics of a template can be found in the statistics tab of a
template (next to the template source code tab). Its statistics include 
the number of errors, clicks, unsubscribes etc, as well as the [key figures](./statistics-key-figures)
table.
