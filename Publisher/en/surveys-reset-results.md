# Surveys: Reset results.

Once a survey has been created you can reset the results. This is useful, 
for example, when you have been testing the survey but don't want to keep 
you dummy data.

You can find the option to reset the results in the **Survey** menu. If 
you wish to save the results first you may choose to [export them](./surveys-export-results.md).

The software will always ask if you are sure you want to delete the survey data.
Please be careful, because once this data is deleted it is gone forever.
