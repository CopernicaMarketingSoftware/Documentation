# Statistics: Webpage statistics

If you have an active website in the Copernica environment the behaviour 
of your users is automatically logged and contains things like (unique) pageviews, 
clicks and how users got to your page. Websites are currently only available 
in Publisher.

You can find the results by going to the **Websites** section. Here you 
select the page you want to view statistics of and click the **Page statistics** 
tab.
