# Follow-up Manager Marketing Suite

The Follow-up manager is a user-friendly tool for creating advanced campaigns. 
Because this tool is integrated within the template editor and the database 
application, you can design advanced and personal follow-up actions at these 
locations. Within the follow-up manager you can combine advanced marketing 
campaigns by combining boxes. Advanced boxes allow you to add extra 
functionalities with JavaScript objects. You can find the available 
objects [here](./data-object).

## Triggers

The Followups starting always with a trigger. This can be a click within 
the template editor or a new or adjusted (sub)profile within the database 
application. From this moment on you can start automating emails based on 
actual data.

## Decision moments

By setting up decision moments, you decide what your customers will see. 
You can set up actions based on customer behavior.

You can easily setup a check to see if:

- A profile is subscribed
- If a profile or subprofile matches a condition
- If a link is clicked

## Insert actions

With an action you can send emails or enrich a profile.

- Delay an action
- You can update a profile
- Create a profile or subprofile
- Unsubscribe or remove a destination
- And you can send an email

## Advanced boxes

Through JavaScript it's also possible to store customer data. You can 
execute these actions later on to develop sophisticated follow-up actions.

With the advanced boxes you can make your own javascript evaluation and 
Javascript execution boxes.
 

## Database application

With the follow-up manager you can easily start automating in the database 
application. The follow-ups always start with a trigger. For example, this 
trigger is a new or modified profile in a database. Around this you can 
automate campaigns with the follow-up manager. You can create follow-up 
actions on both a database and a collection.
Within the database app you can find the followups within the database 
settings.
 
## Template editor
Within the HTML and the drag-n-drop template editor you can make an 
automatic follow-up action on every link.
You will find the Follow-up Manager in the right column by selecting a 
button or link in the drag-n-drop template editor for which you want to 
create a follow-up action. 
Within the HTML template editor you navigate within the Tools menu to 
the link click follow-ups.

You can make a follow-up action in two ways, with the flowchart editor 
and with the script editor.
 
## Script editor
The script editor is just like an advanced box. Here you can use JavaScript 
in order to set up advanced campaigns. These scripts, like in the flowchart 
editor, are executed on the Copernica servers when a link is clicked. You 
can find the available objects [here](./data-object).
