# Follow-up Manager Marketing Suite

The follow-up manager is a user-friendly tool to make advanced campaigns. 
By integrating this tool with the template editor it is made easy to make 
complicated and personalized follow-up actions. The follow-up manager can 
be used when someone clicks on an element, for example a hyperlink, image, 
video or other call-to-action. You could even keep track of what links 
someone clicks in their profile.

You can navigate to the follow-up-manager by selecting a CTA in the 
template editor that you want to create a follow-up for. You can make 
a follow-up with the flowchart editor or with the script editor.

## Flowchart editor

The flowchart editor creates follow-up actions by combining different boxes. 
Some boxes even allow for additional JavaScript programming to add 
extra functionalities. The available objects can be found [here](./followups-scripting).

## Script editor

The script editor is for the more advanced user or programmer. This is 
where you can use JavaScript to create advanced campaigns. These scripts are, 
just like the flowchart editor, executed on the Copernica server if an 
element is clicked. The available objects can be found [here](./followups-scripting).
