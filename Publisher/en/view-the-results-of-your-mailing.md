**Emailings sent:**These are the total number of emailings that have
been sent  with the account, template or document, in the set period of
time.

**Total messages sent:** The sum of messages that have been sent with
the account, template or document.

**Average messages per day:** Total messages sent divided by the total
days in set period of time that have been sent with the account,
template or document.

**Total impressions:** Total impressions recorded. An impression is
recorded when a destination opens the email, and downloads the images.
When a destination opens the email, the included images will be
downloaded from our image server, enabling us to track where and when
the image was downloaded and by who. One subscriber can open your e-mail
more than once. He may open it during work time, and subsequently hours
later when he checks his e-mail at home. Both impressions are registered
for the same person.

**Messages with impression:** Unique impressions (each destination is
only counted once).

**Open rate:** Messages with impression devided by the total number of
messages sent \* 100.
