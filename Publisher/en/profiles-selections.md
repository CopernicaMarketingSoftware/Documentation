What is a selection?
--------------------

In your Copernica
[database](https://www.copernica.com/en/support/video-tutorials/profiles-creating-a-database)
you can create various sorts of collections. Selections allow you to
select
[profiles](https://www.copernica.com/en/support/video-tutorials/profiles-profile-data)
that meet certain requirements. All companies that are located in
Manchester for example. Or all profiles that subscribed for your
newsletters. A selection is a filter on your database.

----------------------------

To create a selections, follow these steps:

-   Log in to Copernica, and go to ‘Profiles’
-   Choose the database you want to create a selection in
-   Select ‘Database management’ and then ‘Manage selections’
-   Click ‘Add selection’
-   Fill in a name and description and hit ‘store’

Well done! You just create a(n empty) selection!

Selection conditions
--------------------

A selections of course is of no use unless you give it conditions. By
letting it check if someone wants to receive your newsletters for
example.

To add conditions, follow these steps:

-   Select ‘[Add a new ‘AND’ condition to a new ‘OR’
    rule](https://www.copernica.com/en/support/or-and-and-selection-conditions)’
-   Select the [condition
    type](https://www.copernica.com/en/support/selection-condition-check-on-mailing-results)
    you want to use
-   Fill in a description for your condition
-   Choose ‘Next’
-   Follow the next steps, depending on the condition type you chose.

You now created a selection with conditions!

Rebuild status
--------------

In the [rebuild
tab](https://www.copernica.com/en/support/how-are-selections-re-built)
you can see if a selection is done building you. You can safely close
this box, without this interrupting the rebuild process.

Viewing your selection
----------------------

-   Select the database you created a selection in
-   Choose your selection
-   On the right, you’ll now see al profiles that are in your selection.

Please keep in mind that, especially with more complicated selections,
it can take a while until the selection has (re)built and all profiles
are visible.
