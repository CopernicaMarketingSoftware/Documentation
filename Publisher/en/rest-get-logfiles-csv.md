# REST API: GET csv logfiles

Copernica keeps logfiles which you can request with the API. This method can be used to download a logfile as CSV using its filename. If you don't know the filename please see "More information" for instructions. To execute the method you can send an HTTP GET request to the following URL for a CSV file without header:

`https://api.copernica.com/v1/logfiles/$filename?access_token=xxxx`

If you want to have a header row with the field names included in the
csv you can send an HTTP GET request to:

`https://api.copernica.com/v1/logfiles/$filename/header?access_token=xxxx`

In both URLs `$filename` is the name of the file you want to request.

## Returned value

A csv file with optionally a header row of the requested log file. In the table below is an example 
of what a CSV file could look like. In the real file, however, the values would be separated by commas 
instead of lines in a table.

| id  |        time         | mailingid | profileid | subprofileid | databaseid | ... |
|-----|---------------------|-----------|-----------|--------------|------------|-----|
| XX1 | 2016-11-04 11:01:00 | 12345     | 111111    | 2            | 123        | ... |
| XX2 | 2016-11-04 11:06:00 | 12346     | 111112    | 3            | 123        | ... |

## PHP Example

The following PHP script demonstrates how to use the API method.

```php
// dependencies
require_once('copernica_rest_api.php');
   
// change this into your access token
$api = new CopernicaRestApi("your-access-token");

// do the call, and print result
print_r($api->get("logfiles/cdm-attempts.2016-11-04.log/header"));
```

The example above requires the [CopernicaRestApi class](rest-php).
