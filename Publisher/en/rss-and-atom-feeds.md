Don't know what content to put on a web page or emailing?
Have you ever thought of a content feed? You decide what content you
want on a certain page or email. Just add an RSS or Atom feed to your
marketing campaign in Copernica.

## Dynamic content with feeds

Content feeds are collections of articles that you publish through
various channels, in your
emails or web pages for example. Use feeds you create yourself in Copernica, or choose
external feeds like the newsfeed of a blog.

In Copernica you can easily include an RSS or Atom feed in your
emailÂ or web page. Compose the articles for a feed with the user friendly
Copernica editor. Easily add various sections to an RSS or Atom feed.
This enables you to sort the articles you add to the feed according to
these sections.

## Designing RSS or Atom feeds with Copernica

In just a few steps, you'll be able to compose the address of your feed
in Copernica. This is the link that points to your content feed when you
use it in your emailing or on your web page. Use style sheets (CSS or
XSLT) for the further layout of your RSS or Atom feed. Create style
sheets in Copernica or upload existing ones through Copernica's import
optionality.
