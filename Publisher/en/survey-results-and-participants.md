The results of a survey are shown in the **Results tab**of the survey
under **Content**.

It displays how many times each answer was given and all open answers.
Also displayed are the total number of questions in the survey and the
total number of participants. These can be both known profiles and
anonymous participants. Which is also the reason why the number of
participants in the results tab can be larger than the number of
participants in the **Participants tab** (in which only known profiles
are displayed).

Known profiles of subprofiles are participants that were logged in when
they completed the survey.
