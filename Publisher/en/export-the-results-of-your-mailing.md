The results (statistics) of a mailing can be exported. You will receive
a text file containing the results of the mailing. The file can then be
imported into excel or other software for further calculations.

1.  First select the mailing of which you want to export the results
    (Via menu Mailings -\> Statistics).
2.  Then click **Export** from the **Mailings menu**.
3.  Choose what kind of information (destinations, impressions, clicks,
    errors) you want to export, and which database or collection fields
    you want to include in the export.
4.  Depending on the previous settings, some extra options may follow.

To export profiles or subprofiles based on the results of a mailing, you
can create a selection based on the results of an email campaign, and
use the export function under profiles to export its content.
