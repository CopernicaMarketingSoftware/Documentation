For each feed you compose under Content, you'll receive both an ATOM and
RSS version. This article explains the differences between the two
formats.

RSS or Atom
-----------

-   RSS is more widely accepted on the internet and is easier to use.
    However the choice between RSS and Atom is determined mainly by the
    target and the medium on which it eventually will be published.
-   The appearance of the RSS and Atom feeds are similar. However Atom
    is better and more powerful than RSS.
-   Atom is flexible and has more features than RSS. It is safer and has
    several advantages compared to RSS.

### Choose the right XSLT

If you're using a custom XSLT for publishing feeds, it is important to a
new feed that this XSLT will also make use of the same type (RSS or
Atom), because they have a different formatting.

The software provides a default XSLT for both RSS and Atom feeds.
