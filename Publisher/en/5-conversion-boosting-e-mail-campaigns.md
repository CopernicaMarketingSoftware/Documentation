Acquiring new customers takes a lot of time, energy and high
investments. But what happens to those customers that bought something
in the past? Most of the time - nothing at all. I come across a lot of
online shops that actually don’t use their data, which – in my opinion –
is a huge miss. Information you have about existing customers can help
you send them relevant offers that help you drive your conversion
through the roof. Forget birthday campaigns – it’s time for some real
conversion stars!

Sure, first impressions are important. A good first impression is what
makes a satisfied customer come back to your online store. But it
doesn’t stop there. Or at least it shouldn’t. If your database is set up
correctly, an online shop automatically collects a lot of data about
your existing customers with every transaction they make. And there is a
huge potential for online shops that actually use this data for targeted
loyalty/[marketing campaigns](./automate-your-campaigns.md).

The following generic type of campaigns can be very useful in your
marketing strategy:

1. Welcome campaigns
--------------------

A good example of a loyalty campaign is a welcome campaign. A welcome
campaign consists of a series of e-mails sent after an initial
registration or sale. Especially for online shops selling complex or
expensive products this can be a very effective way of generating
interest and informing prospects and/or customers.

2. Cross or upsell campaigns
----------------------------

You probably know that [relevancy is the key to
success](./relevancy-the-key-to-increasing-email-open-rates.md)
in email marketing. So if a customer buys a scratching pole for a
kitten, you know that in a few months’ time, when the cat has grown
bigger, it will be needing a higher scratching pole. By setting up
follow up campaigns you can use this knowledge to automatically send
them an offer when that time has come.

3. Abandoned shopping cart campaigns
------------------------------------

Another very effective way of boosting your conversion is sending your
customers an email whenever they abandon their online shopping cart.
Because these campaigns are so relevant for their recipients, abandoned
shopping cart emails can increase conversion rates [by
67%](http://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate) !

4. Win-back/retention campaigns
-------------------------------

Let’s start with the facts:

-   Companies typically lose 50% of their customers every 5 year
-   Companies have a 5 - 10% chance of turning a prospect into a
    customer
-   Companies have a 20 - 40% chance of winning back an ex-customer

What happens to those customers that were once so happy buying from you
– but didn’t come back the following years? It would be a great loss to
just ignore this fact and to just keep on sending generic
news/information, or doing nothing at all. Acknowledge the fact that
they abandoned your shop instead and remind them of your shop. Win
customers back by sending them an 30% discount voucher for their next
purchase if they decide to return to your webshop.

5. Celebrate your customer
--------------------------

Forget birthday campaigns. In the week that someone turns older another
year they’re already flooded with emails wishing them happy birthday,
and sending them ‘special celebration offers’. Strange, seeing that the
birthday boy or girl will probably already be getting a lot of presents
– and not actually having to buy their own. What would you think if a
friend gives you a discount coupon to buy a present in his/her shop on
your birthday? Exactly… Instead of that, try to celebrate the day when a
person became your customer. This will be more likely to convert and is
something innovative.

What you need to get started
----------------------------

Fortunately, a lot of (email) marketing tools offer integrations to
automatically synchronize data from your database, allowing you to setup
targeted email campaigns. So all you actually need are a database and
perhaps an integrated marketing software.

Flexible and dynamic database model
-----------------------------------

To be able to use the available data in your e-marketing strategy you
need a database model that actually supports all of this data, and is
able to use it in a flexible and dynamic way. Regular lists of
subscribers/customers are just not enough!

So, what is a good database? Look for a tool that is able to utilize
lots of data. Preferably go for a multidimensional data model that
secures the customer data, orders, ordered products, abandoned carts,
etc.

For online shops, data like interests, customer group or sex are simple
data that can be used to personalize the campaign. But for triggered
campaigns or drip-marketing it is essential to actually transfer the
complete order history, ordered products and even abandoned cart items.
Within these data packages, attributes like a timestamp, image URL,
product URL, status, title, description and price should be available to
personalize and trigger dynamic campaigns based on your different touch
points.

What it comes down to
---------------------

My message to you is to actually start thinking what data you are
collecting at the moment and how you could use it for automating
strategies. Do some research on what ESP supports your e-commerce
platform and which one supports the above criteria. Remember: it costs 5
times more money to acquire a new customer than to actually retain
existing customers – so please marketers; start using that data!
