How to send an emailing?
------------------------

- Select the document you want to send out in *Emailings*
- Go to *Mailings* and choose *Send mass mailing*
- Agree to the terms of service
- Find the selection you want to send the email to
- If you see the message *The selected destination has no permission set for email*, click *Set the permission for email*
- Select *Do not send the mailing to double addresses* to prevent recipients receiving multiple copies
- Enter a description (optional) and hit *Continue*

You will now get the option to send the emailing immediately, or to schedule for later processing.

- Do you want to send the emailing directly? Select *Send emailing immediately*.
- Do you want to schedule the emailing to be sent out later? Choose Schedule mailing for later processing. You’ll immediately be asked to give a send date and frequency.

Copernica will now perform a final check on the document. If the document contains no errors, hit *Continue*.

Check all data in the next tab, and press *Send* if you’re happy. Please note that once you hit *Send* there is no way of cancelling the deployment of the email.
