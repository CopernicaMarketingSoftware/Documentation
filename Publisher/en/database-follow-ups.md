# Database follow-ups
Automation is the favorite buzzword of many marketeers. Follow-ups in Copernica
can automatically execute or schedule actions based on triggers, making them
a great way to automate your campaigns. For example you can design a campaign
that sends an email when someone clicks your link, or to congratulate
someone on their birthday.

There are several different ways to do this with Copernica software. If you
are new to automating campaigns the easiest way to create follow-ups is with
the user-friendly drag-and-drop editor in the Marketing Suite. Programmers
can use the advanced script editor in the Marketing Suite. Our Publisher offers
a menu editor.

## Marketing Suite
With the [flowchart editor](./follow-up-manager-ms) you can create simple
or created follow-ups by simply chaining boxes together. The user-friendly
interface makes it a great tool for users inexperienced with followups.
Those with more technical knowledge can enable the advanced mode to get
access to powerful features, for example Javascript evaluation and execution
boxes to write your own logic.

## Publisher
[Follow-ups in Publisher](./follow-up-manager-publisher) are always accessible
in the menu of the selected **database**, **document**, **survey** or **web form**.
Follow-ups are created by combining a trigger and an action in the menu editor.
The Publisher does not have a scripting API.

## Script Editor
Programmers can use the full power of Copernica's follow-up system with the
[*data-script* attribute](./data-object.md). You can enrich
every hyperlink in an email, for example, to handle clicks exactly how you
want.

## More information
There are many ways to create follow-ups, so you can try which editor
works better for you. You can also use both, but it is recommended that you
don't create duplicate follow-ups. The articles below provide more information
on how follow-ups work.
