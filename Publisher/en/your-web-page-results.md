Find out how your [web pages](./web-pages.md "Web pages") are
performing with Copernica. Use statistics based on your entire site, or
just look at the results of single pages. This way you'll know which
pages need to be improved and optimised.

Your web page statistics
------------------------

![Your web page
statistics](../images/web-page-statistics-thumb.png "Your web page statistics")

Copernica offers accurate and reliable statistics on your web pages'
performance. You'll get a clear overview of:

-   Number of pageviews: see the exact number of times a certain page on
    your website was viewed. With Copernica you can also see how a web
    page performed within a certain time frame.
-   Number of clicks: find out which hyperlinks generate the most clicks
    on your web page.
-   Traffic sources: see which online channels your web page's visitors
    are coming from. Was it an
    [emailing](./emailings.md "Emailings")
    or did they find it through Google?
-   Most used browsers: want to know which browsers are used to visit
    your web pages? This is also something you can find out in
    Copernica. Always good to know for further optimisation of your web
    pages.
-   Geographical spreading: Copernica can also tell you where your
    visitors are coming from geographically speaking. Is it Europe, the
    US, or somewhere completely different?

In Copernica there will be a clear distinction between the statistics
per web page and the statistics of your entire site.
