# The Publisher Follow-up manager

The Follow-Up Manager within the Publisher provides a handy overview of all follow-ups that are linked to a database, document, form or survey. Also, from here you manage all follow-ups. You can create new follow-ups and edit or remove existing follow-ups.

The Follow-Up Manager is located behind an additional tab at the
database, form, document, or survey.

**Image:** This database has two follow-ups. When a new profile is
created, an email will be sent to the profile. The other follow-up
removes the profile entirely, 5 days after the a profile opted out.*

## Create new follow-ups

If no follow-up actions are linked, you can immediately create one. This
will open the program to make new follow-up actions. The same
functionality can also be accessed via the database / document / form /
survey menu.

To add a new follow-up, click on the item. From here you can also delete
or edit existing follow-up actions.

-   To edit the cause of an existing follow-up action, click the cause
    (a 'cause' is for example: when a profile is modified)
-   To set the delay of the follow-up, click the delay (eg 'Wait 5
    days').
-   To edit the action, click the action of the follow-up (eg: Remove
    the profile or subprofile).

The following database follow-up actions can be made:

    * Send a Publisher document
    * Send a Marketing Suite template
    * Send a PDF document as fax
    * Send a styled SMS
    * send a text mail
    * Send an SMS
    * Create an action point
    * Create a new (sub) profile
    * Delete the data of the addressee
