# The Publisher Follow-up manager

The Follow-Up Manager within the Publisher provides a handy overview of all follow-ups that are linked to a database, document, form or survey. Also, from here you manage all follow-ups. You can create new follow-ups and edit or remove existing follow-ups.

The Follow-Up Manager is located behind an additional tab at the
database, form, document, or survey.

**Image:** This database has two follow-ups. When a new profile is
created, an email will be sent to the profile. The other follow-up
removes the profile entirely, 5 days after the a profile opted out.*

## Create new follow-ups

You can make a new follow-up from the database, collection, document, form 
or survey menu. You will see a menu where you can choose a trigger and 
an action.

Existing follow-ups can also be edited by clicking on them.
