# License and billing information

This article describes how to obtain a license for Copernica software 
and information on payment structure and billing.

## License

You need a license to use Copernica software. You can obtain this license 
by logging into the [Marketing Suite](https://ms.copernica.com/#/menu/login) 
with the credentials of your Copernica account. If you do not have these 
yet you can create them [here](https://www.copernica.com/en/copernica-trial).

## Payment structure

### Base payment and email

You pay a small amount each month to use Copernica software, which 
includes a certain amount of emails. If you want to create some extra 
accounts you pay extra, but for companies sending their own email this is 
usually not necessary. You can choose to pay-as-you-go or at the end of the 
month. If you pay-as-you-go you always need enough credit to send the amount 
of emails you want to send. If you want to send 100.001 emails, but only have 
enough credit for 100.000 emails, you will need to increase your balance 
first. If you have any credit left at the month this will be transferred 
to the next month.

The costs for an email are variable and depend on the amount of emails 
already sent. The more emails you sent in a month, the higher the discount 
for future emails in that month. It is also possible to buy a bundle if 
you already know how many messages you will send. If you choose to use a 
bundle your credit will not be transferred at the end of the month.

### API calls

API call billing works very similar to email billing. A certain amount 
of API calls is included, after which the costs are variable. There are 
also bundles available for API calls. If you have remaining credit from 
paying upfront it will be transferred. Remaining bundle calls can not be 
transferred.

### Other variable costs

Apart from email you can also send mailings with SMS or fax. The price 
per fax or SMS is set and there are no bundles available. Publisher still 
offers the option to make and host webpages and surveys, for which the costs 
are variable as well. Finally there are [Litmus](./litmus) previews available 
to view your email in different environments when working with Publisher. 
The costs for using Litmus are passed on.

### Current prices 

For the current prices please refer to the overview on our

## Billing

Your account is automatically charged according to your account usage and 
you receive a receipt or invoice at the end of each month with the costs 
associated with the last month.
