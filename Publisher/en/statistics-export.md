### Mailing/template statistics

The results (statistics) of a mailing can be exported. You will receive
a text file containing the results of the mailing. The file can then be
imported into excel or other software for further calculations.

1.  First select the mailing/template of which you want to export the results. 
    Find the correct document or template under **E-mailings** and select it. 
    Click on statistics and then click the option for a full report.
2.  Then click **Export** from the **Mailings** menu.
3.  Choose what kind of information (destinations, impressions, clicks,
    errors) you want to export, and which database or collection fields
    you want to include in the export.
4.  Depending on the previous settings, some extra options may follow.

To export profiles or subprofiles based on the results of a mailing, you
can create a selection based on the results of an email campaign, and
use the export function under profiles to export its content.

### Account mailing statistics

If you want to export all mailing statistics for an account first go 
to the **E-mailings** menu. From here click **Mailings** > **Statistics** 
and click on the option "Show full statistics report" on the bottom of the 
page. If you click **Mailing** again the menu will now offer the option 
"Export results...".

## More information

The REST API is another good way to export your results. You can write 
your own script to periodically request and store your statistics, for 
example. Find out more in the articles below.
