A bulk mailing can be sent immediately, but you can also configure the
mailing to be sent at a later time. You can also choose to repeat the
sending periodically, such as daily or weekly.

Tip: Make sure you configure the mailing to be sent at an early time in
the morning or in the late evening hours. Your boss will think you're
working at special hours for him, which will give you huge props (while
you're actually sleeping or watching tv)!

### Setting the mailing

To schedule a mailing and / or repeat it periodically, you follow the
same steps as when sending a mailing directly.

One additional thing: In step 2, click on the tab **When** for the extra
settings.

-   Choose the date and time when you want to start the mailing.
-   If you want to repeat the mailing periodically, you can specify
    directly below.
-   Choose at which interval the mailings should be sent and specify how
    many times the mailing should be repeated.
