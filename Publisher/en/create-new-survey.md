# Surveys

Surveys are a very powerful tool to learn how contacts think of your
company, your service, products or whatever you like to know about them.

Surveys are easily created and can be published on your website in a
wink. If you link to this website from an emailing individual answers 
given are even automatically linked to the profile.

To add a new survey to the application, use the function labeled so
under the **Survey menu** of **Content**.

Choose a descriptive name and an optional description. Once your survey
is created you can start adding questions. For more information on 
adding questions please see

## Adding questions to the survey

1.  In the survey menu, find the **New question** option.
2.  You can immediately start creating the first question. Enter the
    name of the question, and [choose the type of the
    question](./survey-question-types.md).
    The text editor allows you to place 'underwriting' to your question,
    such as 'please check only one box'.
