This selection type enables you to find the profiles and/or subprofiles
who missed your survey or just forgot to fill out the survey (and send
them a reminder). You can specify the type of submitter (profile,
subprofile or both), the survey (or any survey) and the period in which
the survey was submitted.

You can also make mini selection of this condition type.

The following options are available:

**The survey must have been submitted by a profile**\
 *The profile is included in the selection if he (the profile itself)
has submitted the survey.*

**The survey must have been submitted by a subprofile**\
 *The profile is included in the selection if one of its subprofiles
have submitted the survey.*

**The survey must have been submitted by a profile or a subprofile**\
 *The profile is included in the selection if either he or one of its
subprofiles have submitted the survey.*

**The survey has not been submitted by a profile or a subprofile**\
 *The profile is included in the selection if he did not submit the
survey, and its subprofiles did also not submit the survey.*

**The survey has not been submitted by a profile but it may have been
submitted by a subprofile**\
 *The profile is included in the selection if he did not submit the
survey, even if it was (or was not) submitted by one of its
subprofiles.*

**The survey has not been submitted by a subprofile but it may have been
submitted by a profile**\
 *The profile is included in the selection if none of its subprofiles
have submitted the survey, even if the profile himself did (or did not)
submit the survey.*
