Owning an email inbox can, at times, feel like a game of guard the
castle, where you have to defend it from unsolicited – and sometimes
solicited – emails you have no interest in reading.
According to research conducted by Smarter Tools, an average email
account receives about 65 emails a day. Common sense tells us that we
can safely assume that a lot of those emails are moved to the trash can
without getting so much as even a glance. So how do you ensure that your emails are not the ones that are being
thrown away unread? Or to put it in other words: how do you make sure
your emails get the open rate they deserve? By being relevant, that’s
how.

rates](../images/email-open-rates-copernica.png)

Determining relevancy
---------------------

The first thing you need in order to send relevant emails is
a [database](./creating-your-own-databases.md "Marketing with your database") where
you store information about your clients, prospects or recipients. What
products are they interested in? Which kind of emails have worked best
for them in the past?

Assuming you only recruit opt-ins that have interest in the product
you’re selling, or at least have some affinity with the industry you
operate in, this shouldn’t be too hard.

Divide and conquer
------------------

Using the information in your database, you can start sending your
recipients relevant information. Centuries ago the Romans built an
empire by adopting the “divide and conquer” strategy, and now it’s your
turn to conquer your customers’ attention using the same technique.

By [segmenting your database](./define-target-groups-with-selections.md)
you are able to approach recipients personally, providing them
with relevant content. And one of the best ways to do so is by sending
event-driven emails.

What are event-driven emails?
-----------------------------

An event-driven email, as the name suggests, is an email that is sent
after an event takes place. For instance, when you email someone a user
manual for the product they purchased in your webshop yesterday. Because
of their relevancy, event-driven emails not only help you increase your
open rate, they also give your conversion rates a boost.

Take the [abandoned shopping cart
email](./abandonded-shopcarts.md "Abandonded shopcarts") for
example, reminding your customers of a purchase they didn’t finish.
Research suggests that up 75% of online shoppers abandon their shopping
cart during the purchase process. However, up to 20% of these shoppers
can be won back if you use abandoned shopping carts.

What it comes down to
---------------------

The last thing your recipients want is for you to contribute to the
endless stream of useless emails they are swamped with every day. 

Don’t send your customers an email with an iPhone5 offer a week after
they already bought a new mobile phone in your webshop. Not only will it
annoy them, it’s also a waste of your time and effort.

Your energy can be spent better on creating relevant emails your
recipients are interested in.
