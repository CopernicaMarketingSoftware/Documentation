E-mail addresses in your database or selection can be checked and
repaired for validity. We have compiled a list of common errors such as
*@htmail.com* or *@hotmail,com* (instead of @hotmail.com). This list is
used to filter out typing errors and obvious errors in the part after
the @.

The function is found under *Profiles \> Database management \>*
**Repair e-mail addresses**.

**Warning:** this is an automated process. There is no guarantee that
the repaired e-mail addresses are correct. Only certain errors will be
repaired.
