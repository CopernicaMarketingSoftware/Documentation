About the Shopware integration
------------------------------

With this Shopware Copernica integration you will be able to transfer
all the information relevant to your newsletter on-the-fly to Copernica
and in short intervals (e.g. every 15 minutes). The integration
transfers the following data:

-   All customer data including opt-in (or double opt-in)
-   All order data
-   All ordered products
-   All abandoned shop carts

Thanks to the Copernica database you can plan automated event-triggered
mailings. Based on a particular order pattern, for example, you could
automatically offer your customers specific cross-selling products. Use
the assets of Copernica Marketing Software to make your marketing
campaigns even more efficient than they already are.

This integration is presented to you by eliomedia GmbH. eliomedia will
also assist you in implementing the integration. For the integration to
work correctly, you will need an active installation of the Shopware
Cronjob Plugin, an active server cronjob on your webserver as well as an
account with Copernica. Please note! The downloadable integration is
compiled for Shopware version 4.1.2 and PHP 5.3. Please contact us prior
to installation, we will then compile a custom-built integration for
your domain and assist you in implementing it. As soon as the
integration is activated, data will be transferred to Copernica. A
complete initial import can provide Copernica with previously existing
data. We can offer our integration for Shopware versions 3.5.6, 3.5.7
and 4.x.x.

The plug-in is free.
