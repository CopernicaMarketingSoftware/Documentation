# **destination** variable

A variable that gives access to current emailing destination. This variable might
be either an alias to a [**profile**](./followups-scripting-profile.md) or a
[**subprofile**](./followups-scripting-subprofile.md). It's set to profile if
emailing was sent to a database or selection. It's set to a subprofile if emailing
was sent to a collection or mini-selection.
