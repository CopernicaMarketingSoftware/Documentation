# PDF's in Copernica

Copernica allows you to create PDF documents for fax mailings,
advertisements, brochures and other printed material. Or more
importantly create personalized PDF documents to send in e-mailings.

To create personalized PDF files you need **Adobe Acrobat Pro** and the
free plugin from **PDFlib**.

Note: The plugin doesnâ€™t work with Acrobat Elements or any version of
Adobe Reader.

Fonts you use in your blocks must be [uploaded to
Copernica](./uploading-fonts.md).
Otherwise, text is not displayed at all.
