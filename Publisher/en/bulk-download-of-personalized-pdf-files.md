PDF files that you manage in the PDF section can be downloaded as a
single file or in a bulk download from a selection or miniselection.

### Download PDF file

A PDF document can be downloaded to your computer. The downloaded PDF
will be personalized with data from your test destination, just like
when you send a test e-mail.

You can find the option to download the PDF file in the *Document*menu.

### Mass download of PDF files

A PDF document can also be downloaded in bulk. If you have used
personalization, the download will contain a personalized file for each
recipient.

Find the option **Mass download** in the *Document* menu

If any, you see a list of previously generated downloaded.

-   Click on **'Start new export**'
-   Choose the selection of miniselection the download should be
    personalized with.
-   In addition, you specify whether you want to download a large PDF
    file or a separate file for each recipient. The seperate PDF files
    are then bundled in a ZIP-file.

The file is made immediately. Once this is finished, you will see a blue
underlined hyperlink in the window. Click on it to start the download.\
