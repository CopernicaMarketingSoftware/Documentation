The first time you send an email can be a nerve-racking moment. Will it
all go well? Is your email going to reach the right people? With
Copernica Marketing Software however, these are things you won’t have to
worry about anymore. Copernica’s software allows you to easily send a
newsletter or targeted email to one or multiple contacts.

Send your emails to a selection or your entire database
-------------------------------------------------------

Firstly you need to determine who you are sending your email to. Is your
message targeted to just a
small [selection](./define-target-groups-with-selections.md "Define target groups with selections"),
or to your entire
[database](./creating-your-own-databases.md "Creating your own database")?

Within Copernica you can easily apply segmentation with the help of
selections. Split your send list into smaller and more relevant target
audiences to get a higher response rate from your email campaigns.

Send now or later?
------------------

Decide if you want to send an email straight away or at a later time.
This function helps you to easily plan a complete email campaign. Send a
birthday email on a certain day for instance, or a weekly newsletter
with the latest updates. You decide the time that it is sent and the
recipients you want the newsletter to go to. Copernica will take care of
the rest. Did you know that with Copernica, you can also [send email
campaigns
automatically](./automate-campaigns.md "Automate your email campaigns")?

Excellent deliverability rates with Copernica
---------------------------------------------

You wouldn’t want to invest a lot of time and effort in composing an
email, just to find out later that it didn’t even arrive in your
contacts inbox. That’s why Copernica checks your email before it’s sent
out to ensure it’ll pass through spam filters. Copernica checks to make
sure:

-   Your email has an opt-out function.
-   Your email has a low spam score.
-   You are on not a blacklist.
-   Your HTML source code is correct.
-   Your authentication data (SPF & DKIM) is set up
    correctly.

All of these methods will help make sure your email reaches its
destination.

Want to be 100% sure? Ask for a Return Path Sender certificate. This’ll
put you on the world’s largest whitelist and improve your delivery rate
to over 1.8 billion inboxes worldwide.

at the click of a button.

Additional help with opt outs and spam complaints
-------------------------------------------------

When sending emails, it’s very important to have a send list that is up
to date. That’s why Copernica offers a variety of handy tools that help
you process opt outs and spam reports.

### Use of feedback loops

Through this function Copernica automatically processes spam complaints
from your contacts. When you use Copernica, usage of Hotmail’s feedback
loop program is automatically included. For other programs you can
easily sign up yourself. Below are a few examples of other feedback loop
programs:

### List-unsubscribe header

With this function you can easily add an unsubscribe button to your
emails. In Windows Live (among others), this function will even replace
the *report spam* button with an unsubscribe button.

We advise you to use this header with all you emails. Not only will it
make your life easier, it will also help you maintain a good sender
reputation. \
At Copernica we are proud to help you achieve optimal delivery of your
emails.
