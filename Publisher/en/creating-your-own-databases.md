You are free to structure your database any way you like with Copernica.
There are no limitations to the number of database fields you can
create. Save all the information about your contacts in Copernica so
you’re able to use them in your
[emailings](./emailings.md "Emailings"),
for example.

An overview of the different types of fields you can create and use with
Copernica:

-   Text field
-   Numeric field
-   Multiple choice field
-   Date field
-   Email field
-   Large text field
-   Interest field

With the field type interest, for example, you are able to easily add
interests or preferences to the profile of your contacts. This field is
often used in combination with a
[webform](./various-types-of-web-forms.md "Various types of web forms")
or a
[survey](./create-your-own-survey.md "Surveys").

Store more data in a multidimensional database
----------------------------------------------

A multidimensional database is a database that is built up in multiple
levels. With a multidimensional database you are be able to communicate
in a more direct way and on a more personal level with your contacts.

### How does it work?

In Copernica you can easily store extra data about a profile. A profile
contains information like a name and address, for example. The extra
data is stored in a collection. A collection contains data or
‘subprofiles’ that are connected to a profile. For example, purchases
made through an ecommerce site. In this particular case a subprofile
contains all information about an item purchased through an ecommerce
site including name, purchase date and price.

This way a contact only has to be in the database once, without having
to have a complicated and disjointed profile. By using a
multidimensional database you are able to keep a clear overview of
contacts in your database. Most CRM systems and e-commerce solutions
work with multidimensional databases also, allowing you to seamlessly
connect Copernica with other systems.
