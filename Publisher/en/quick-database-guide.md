# Setting up a database

Copernica works with multidimensional databases, which you can
structure yourself. Multidimensional databases give you enormous 
flexibility and freedom, because you can determine which fields
and how many layers you want to add to your database. There are 
almost no restrictions given for a certain database design. 
It's for example perfectly possible to just set up an easy to 
grasp firstname-lastname-emailaddress-structure or to make it
slightly more advanced by using a nested database to store 
purchase history and abandoned shopping carts. However, in the
beginning it's wise to just keep things simple. You can always
add fields later on. 

## Fields, interests and collections

A field in a database can encompass an interest or collection.
An interest can only consist of the value "yes" or "no".
Collections are a little more complicated, because you kind of
add a new layer to your database. In a collection you can add 
multiple items like: "first name", "last name" en "email address".
Concluding, collections are structure-wise more or less 
identical to databases. 

## Database intentions

There are various things to set up when designing databases. 
One is database intentions, in which you can specify whether 
a database is suitable for sending mailings. You can also set 
a variety of rules to which data must comply in order to be 
added to the databases. You can do this with database 
*intentions*. 

## Creating profiles

Databases need of course data to be of any value. The sets of 
data you acquire are called `DATABASE & PROFILES` inside 
Copernica. You can get a grasp of how to work with profiles
by making a profile with your own details. 

You can test your emails constantly by sending an email to a
*pre-determined test destination*. This is a profile from the
database that is marked as the profile for test emails.
This email address is most likely your own.
