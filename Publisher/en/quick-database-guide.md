# Setting up a database
Copernica works with entirely configurable databases. It's up to you to decide on the structure of your databases, so your data always fits into Copernica. On top of that, Copernica databases are multidimensional. 
This means your database can have multiple layers to support things like collections of webshop orders per profile.

The database forms the core of your marketing campaigns. It holds all profile data for making selections and for 
personalizing emails. Data can also continually be enriched through actions performed by recipients, such as opening or 
clicking certain things. This allows you to keep improving your mailings constantly. While some of our users prefer creating
new databases every now and then and importing all profile data again, we advise to keep using the same database, 
but structuring it well. This way, your database will keep on growing richer with feedback from previous campaigns. 
Selections allow you to segment your database and use it for targeted campaigns without having to import all data again.


## Marketing Suite
You can manage your databases easily by navigating to the *PROFILES* tab within the Marketing Suite. Create databases, add filters, edit selections and much more. The options are endless.

## Multidimensional
In Copernica, you'll come across the the words “collection” and “subprofile” quite often. These apply to multidimensional 
databases, as described above. In a simple database with one layer, we use only single data fields and interests. For example:
a store owner could keep a database containing his customers' first and last names, email addresses and where they live. 
These records are called profiles in Copernica.

A simple database like this could be extended into a multidimensional one by adding a collection. In this case, it could be 
a collection “orders” in which all orders a customer has placed are stored, along with their respective date and price. 
Every profile in the database gets their own collection of past orders, so the store owner can see what each customer has 
purchased in his shop and when. Based on this, he could send targeted mailings to customers who have bought a certain product
in the past. A profile in a collection is called a subprofile.

This is just one example of a multidimensional database model. Other examples are a database of 
companies and a collection containing the employees of each company, or one of parents, with a collection 
containing their children.

## Database intentions
There are various things to set up when designing databases. One is database intentions,
in which you can specify whether a database is suitable for sending mailings. You can also set a variety of rules to which
data must comply in order to be added to the databases. You'll find these settings under the *PROFILES* tab in
the Marketing Suite.
 
## Creating profiles
After you've created the database and added fields to it, it is time to add data to it. We call these data *profiles* and they can be added through the profile module in Copernica. To test some things, it's best to start out with a test profile containing your own data.

If you plan on using Copernica to design and send email, you can send test emails all through the process at any given time. These tests are sent to your *test destination*. It's logical to set your own profile as the test destination

## The next step
