# Setting up a database

Copernica works with multidimensional databases, which you can
structure yourself. Multidimensional databases give you enormous 
flexibility and freedom, because you can determine which fields
and how many layers you want to add to your database. There are 
almost no restrictions given for a certain database design. 
It's for example perfectly possible to just set up an easy to 
grasp firstname-lastname-emailaddress-structure or to make it
slightly more advanced by using a nested database to store 
purchase history and abondoned shopping carts. However, in the
beginning it's wise to just keep things simple. You can always
add fields later on. 


## Fields, interest and collections

## Database intentions

There are various things to set up when designing databases. One is 
database intentions, in which you can specify whether a database is
suitable for sending mailings. You can also set a variety of rules
to which data must comply in order to be added to the databases. 
You'll find these settings under the 'profiles' tab in the Marketing
Suite.
 
## Creating profiles

After you've created the database and added fields to it, it is time to add data to it. We call these data *profiles* and they can be added through the profile module in Copernica. To test some things, it's best to start out with a test profile containing your own data.

If you plan on using Copernica to design and send email, you can send test emails all through the process at any given time. These tests are sent to your *test destination*. It's logical to set your own profile as the test destination

## The next step
Once your database is ready and filled with your profile, you're ready to [make your first mailing](quick-mailing-guide) to further discover the magic of Copernica.
