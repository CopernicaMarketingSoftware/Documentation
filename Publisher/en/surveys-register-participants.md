# Surveys: Register participants

If you want to record who fills out the survey and what answers were
given by them you can send them an email in which you invite them to
participate. In the email you refer to the survey with a personalized
hyperlink.

For example, if your survey is published on
*http://www.yourcompany.com/survey*

Use the following link:

**Mailing to profiles:**

http://www.yourcompany.com/survey*?profile={\$profile.id}&code={\$profile.code}*\

**Mailing to subprofiles:**

http://www.yourcompany.com/survey*?subprofile={\$subprofile.id}&code={\$subprofile.code}*

After the participant completed the survey, you can look up his or her
answers at the tab **Surveys** at the profile of the participant. You can also 
download a file detailing each participants answers in XML or Excel format.
See [exporting results](./surveys-export-results) for more information on 
downloading these files.
