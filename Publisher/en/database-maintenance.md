# Tips on maintaining your database

A clean and up-to-date database is very important for a good email campaign. 
It's important to know who to approach and how. When you are [personalizing](./personalization)
your email campaigns it's important to know that your data is accurate.
This is also important for a good [deliverability](./deliverability "Deliverability") 
and a good [sender reputation](./sender-reputation "Sender reputation").

## Maintenance tips

1.  Keep all data in one central file or program. This prevents you from 
    searching for it and having to update multiple files. With the [REST API](./rest-api) 
    it's also possible to download the data that Copernica gathers to 
    your own server.
2.  Provide insight into your data by using clear descriptive names, tabs 
    and definitions of data. [Selections](selections-introduction) 
    enable you to view one database in multiple ways, for example by 
    target group, completed campaigns or relation types.
3.  Keep your database complete by adding new information directly. Make 
    all employees add data directly instead of saving it elsewhere. You 
    can add all contacts of the organization in one file for example, to 
    make sure everyone has access to everything.
4.  Keep your database up-to-date. Handle unsubscribes, bounces and 
    mutations when they occur. It's most effective to clean your database 
    after each mailing. Permanent errors are bad for your reputation and 
    corrupt your database and may cause you to be blocked by clients' spam 
    filters. It also makes your results less accurate. For an example of 
    bounce handling you can consult [this article](./automatically-process-bounces).
5.  Allow your profiles access to their own data with an [edit form](./webforms)
    or a URL. This way they can contribute their own data and help you 
    keep your database up-to-date.
6.  Enrich existing profiles with results of previous campaigns. Good 
    marketing software will save this information automatically, so don't 
    forget to use it!
7.  Check your permissions for sending email to a profile to prevent 
    spam markings. Create an [opt-in](./create-a-double-optin-for-new-subscribers) 
    to make sure your profiles want to receive your mail.
8.  Use your database to keep relations. Out of sight, out of mind. Keep 
    your customers attention by sending them a nice email on their birthday 
    or to remind them of maintenance for their products.

If your data is well-organized and insightful your marketing team will have 
more opportunities in approaching your customers. Good data allows for [personalizing](./personalization) 
for target groups and much more.
