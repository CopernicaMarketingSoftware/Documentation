# Surveys in Publisher

Surveys are a very powerful tool in Publisher to learn how contacts think 
of your company, your service, products or whatever you like to know about them.

Surveys are easily created and can be published on your website in a
wink. If you [link to this website from an
emailing](./linking-to-your-website-from-an-emailing.md),
individual answers given are even automatically linked to the profile.

To add a new survey to the application, use the function labeled so
under the **Survey menu** of **Content**.

Choose a descriptive name and an optional description. Once your survey
is created you can start adding questions. For more information on 
adding questions please see [question types](./surveys-question-types.md)
en [question options](./surveys-question-options.md)

## Adding questions to the survey

1.  In the survey menu, find the **New question** option.
2.  You can immediately start creating the first question. Enter the
    name of the question and [choose the type of the
    question](./surveys-question-types.md).
    The text editor allows you to place 'underwriting' to your question to
    explain the question further to your users. An example would be to 
    instruct your users to 'please check only one box'.
