# Surveys: Archiving

If you have gathered enough information from a survey there are a few things 
you can do. You can [delete](./surveys-delete), optionally after 
[exporting data](./surveys-export-results). The second option is to archive it. 
By archiving you can still access the results in the software, but no new 
answers will be accepted.

To archive a survey first go to the **Survey menu**. Click **Archive** 
and select **The survey is archived** in the **Archive status menu**. 
The survey is now archived.
