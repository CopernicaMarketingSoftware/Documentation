By default PDF templates and documents only know the font Helvetica. If
you want to use a different font, you need to upload the font to
Copernica first. You are able to do so from the menu *Extra...*

Once you have uploaded a font it remains valid for all templates and
documents.

### Name of font

Give your fonts a descriptive name (the actual name of the font will
do). Note that the name of the font is caSe SenSitive! The name of the
font should match exactly at the PDFlib content block setting
*'FontName'*. Do not name your font "verdana", when the name
'**V**erdana' is used at the configuration of your content block .

### Font format

Only fonts of the following formats can be uploaded: *pfa*,. *pfb*.
*ttf*and. *otf.* When using .*pfa*and .*pfb*the second line ('metrics')
should be supplemented with a .*afm*or .*pfm*font

### Bold and italic fonts

**Bold**and *italic* fonts from Windows usually have their own files, eg
*verdana.ttf*, *verdanab.ttf* and *verdanai.ttf*. You need to upload all
types seperately to be able to use them in your PDF documents.
