Feedback loops are used to process abuse reports (**complaints**) from
feedback loop providers.

The feedback loop providers are parties like Yahoo and Hotmail who
shield email recipients from spam. They provide feedback programs for
legitimate businesses to subscribe to, so their email won't be blocked
as spam. If a recipient of an email from a registered company presses
the spam button on their email, a message is sent back to the company to
inform them and deal with the reporter.

To register and deal with these complaints, apply to the loopback
programs listed below. If you instruct these programs to send back their
reports in the **ARF (Abuse Report Format)** to the abuse address (this
address is found under *emailings \> Extra \>* **Abuse Reports**), the
software can unsubscribe people who file a report automatically. These
reports are also tracked and a record can be found with the email
statistics under the tab 'Complaints'.

To handle the abuse reports properly, make sure to tell the database how
to deal with the reporting profiles under **Profiles** (*do nothing,
remove them, change a field value from their profile*). [Configure the
unsubscribe behaviour](#)

Registering and unsubscribing recipients who make complaints, improves
your sender reputation and the deliverability of your emails. Abuse
reports will be reported back to you as part of the email statistics
with each mailing and on a general overview in emailings.
