If you used the import to create new profiles only, the answer is yes.
If you updated existing profiles as well, the affected profiles can only
be reverted separately using the [Rollback profile
function](./rollback-profile-to-previous-state.md).

### Remove profiles that were imported

Create a selection to select only profiles that were created when the
import was running.

-   Use the selection condition **Check on changes**
-   At *Change type*, select **The profile was created.**
-   Select the period of time in which the import was running.
-   Store the selection. Double check if the selection only contains the
    profiles that should be removed.

Remove the profiles of the selection

-   Go to Current view \> **Edit / Remove multiple profiles.**
-   Choose the selection that you wish to empty.
-   Click **Remove** to remove the profiles (this action comes with a
    confirmation).
