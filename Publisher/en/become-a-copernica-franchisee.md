# Become a Copernica franchisee

Copernica BV is growing internationally via its network of partners. A 
partner can obtain franchise rights by performing well. This gives the 
partner exclusive rights to sell Copernica software in a country or region.

Copernica BV constantly researches the international market for opportunities 
to grow further. Employees of Copernica are constantly visiting conventions, 
making business trips and seeking information from renowned research companies.

If there is sufficient potential in a country or region Copernica acquires 
medium-sized webbureaus that have a [partner license](http://www.copernica.com/nl/partners/5-manieren-om-inkomsten-te-genereren "Waarom een Partnerlicentie?").
When these partners are interested and performing well we discuss the 
opportunities of a franchise license together.

## Responsibilities of Copernica franchisee

A Copernica franchisee carries big responsibilities with it. Therefore we 
carefully consider the suitability of a partner to become a franchisee.

A franchisee is for example responsible for everything sales and marketing 
related in their country or region. These mainly include acquiring more 
partners and users. You are also responsible for providing immediate support to users.

## Responsibilities of Copernica BV

the products as well as secondary [support](http://www.copernica.com/en/articles/ondersteuning "Ondersteuning")
