# REST API Overview

The REST API allows you to retrieve and update the data that is stored inside
Copernica from out of your own website or app. You can write your own scripts
that send requests and instructions to our servers to fetch this data or
to update it. You can use this API to automatically synchronize the data in
Copernica with your own system, without any human interference. This page
contains an overview of all API versions.
