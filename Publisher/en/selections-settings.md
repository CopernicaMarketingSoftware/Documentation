# Management options for selections

Apart from creating and deleting, there's more you can do to manage 
your selections. Below, you'll find an overview of management options 
for selections and miniselections.

### Copying and moving selections

It's not improbable that at some point, you'll accidentally create a 
selection in the wrong place. This is not a big problem: Copernica 
allows you to easily move the selection to the right location. 
Additionally, you might want selections that are almost, but not 
entirely the same. In this case, it's easier to copy a selection and 
modify it than to create one from scratch.

When you move a selection, you automatically move any subselections 
along with the selection. This is optional when copying a selection. 
Note that no two selections can have the same name in your database. 

Copying or moving a selection can be done under *profiles* > *edit 
selections*. In doing so, no profiles are lost.

### Displaying profiles in a (mini) selection

You can display the profiles in a selection by simply clicking its name. 
For profiles in mini selections, go to *current view* and click 
*subprofiles*.

### Authorize a selection for emails

Before you can start sending emails to profiles in a selection, you must 
first authorize it for email sending. Go to the Marketing Suite and 
select its intentions when creating it. Setting intentions prevents you 
from accidentally sending emails to selections that should not receive 
emails, such as unsubscribers. If these options are not clickable, 
it's probably because you don't have a corresponding field in your 
database. You'll need to create these first.

### Delete, deactivate or archive?

It's a good idea to (temporarily) remove selections you never or rarely 
use from your database. Copernica has three options to do that: delete, 
deactive or archive. A selection that is not used at all is best deleted. 
Selections are rebuilt often, which takes up computing power. Therefore, 
having less selections will make your database faster. Removing a 
selection does not mean the profiles in it are removed.

Deactivating a selection is useful for selections you're not currently 
using, but do plan on using again in the future. This will also cause 
your other selections to build quicker. When you want to use a 
deactivated selection, simply reactivate it and it'll still be there in 
its original form. It is not possible to deactivate a selection in its 
entirety, but you can deactivate its conditions, which has the same 
effect. 

Lastly, selections can be archived. That way, you can see which ones 
you currently use and which are not as important. Note that archived 
selections remain active, so they still take up computing power and 
make your database slower. If you're going for performance, it's best 
to delete or deactivate selections.
