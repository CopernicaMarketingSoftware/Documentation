# Websites in Copernica

In the Copernica Publisher it is made easy to create and host your own 
webpage. You can use these pages to inform your customers or place webforms 
and surveys to get to know your customers. You can use a [template](./templates) 
for your website and edit the source code with ease. It's also possible 
to use [personalization](./personalization) if your users are logged in.

You can also link the website to a subdomain of your own website. This 
prevents users from seeing your website is hosted by Copernica and makes 
it look more trustworthy and professional in general.
