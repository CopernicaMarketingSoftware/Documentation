A birthday selection will, on a daily basis, select contact persons that
have their birthday today. This is how you create one.

1.  Create a new selection and choose the condition type ‘**Check on
    date**’.
2.  Select the field in which you have stored the dates of birth.

Because this selection should select different people every single day,
we must use the variable date.

1.  The date in the field must be after -*0 days ago*- and after- *0
    days ago*-. Both *floored to days*.
2.  **The year should not be identical**. Otherwise it would only select
    people who are literally born today. Not a big chance that you'll
    have any of such in your database.

[Schedule a daily mailing](#) to this selection. Make sure you test the
mailing before you reveal the final campaign.
