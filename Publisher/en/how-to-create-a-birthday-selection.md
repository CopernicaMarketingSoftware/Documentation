A birthday selection will, on a daily basis, select contact persons that
have their birthday today. Take the following steps to create one such selections:

1. Create a new selection and choose the condition type ‘**Check on
    date**’.
2. Select the field in which you have stored the dates of birth.
3. Pick a variable date and set it to **after** 0 days ago and **before** 0 days ago. Round both dates to days. The year should not be identical, because otherwise you'd only select profiles born on that day, in that year, and those probably don't exist in your database (and it also doesn't serve the purpose of the selection).
4. Save it, and plan a daily mailing to this selection to congratulate your customers on their birthday!
