# Follow-ups: Importing & Exporting

Exporting and importing follow-ups in Marketing Suite is very convenient, 
but should always be done with care. In the follow-up editor you will see 
a button to export the follow-up in JSON. This allows you to adapt and re-use 
follow-ups with ease. 

However, there are a few things to consider when importing and exporting, especially 
when using follow-ups someone else created:

* Follow-ups can have a name, description and comments and all of these 
are exported along with the boxes and connections. You might want to 
make sure the language used here is appropriate.
* Different databases and collections might have different fields. Make sure 
all the fields you want to access exist and are named correctly.
* You might need to select the correct database or selection yourself. Don't 
forget this, or your follow-up will not be able to access the data you need.
* Be very careful with what you import; it's possible to remove entire 
(sub)profiles with a follow-up. This action is irreversible.
