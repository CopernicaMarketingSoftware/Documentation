# Feedback loops

Feedback loops in the Marketing Suite are now called [WebHooks](./webhooks). 
Besides the new name, nothing will change in the way they function. 
These WebHooks can be used to send real-time information to your own server, 
for example to nofity you about opens, clicks and bounces. You can also 
use them to notify you about profile creates, edits and deletes.

## Microsoft's, Gmail's and Yahoo's feedback loops

Another type of feedback loop is the feedback loop that ESP's 
(Email service providers) such as Microsoft or Gmail offer. These 
feedback loops can be used to notify senders when a message is reported 
as spam or interacts with the email. These loops are used to send 
aggregated information to us, while our feedback loops send 
notifications to you in real-time. Copernica handles spam reports for 
you according to your unsubscribe behavior.
