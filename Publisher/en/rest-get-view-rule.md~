# REST API: fetching rule data

Selections use *rules* to decide which profiles are included in the selection
and which profiles are not. Profile that match at least on of the selection rules 
are included in the selection. To retrieve the properties and the conditions of a 
single rule, you can send a HTTP GET request to the following URL:

`https://api.copernica.com/v1/view/$id/rule/$id?access_token=xxxx`

The first $id code should be replaced with the numeric identifier of the 
selection from which you want to retrieve a rule. The second $id parameter
should be the ID of the rule.

## The returned properties

This method returns rule data. The following properties are returned:

- **ID**: numeric ID of the rule
- **name**: name of the rule
- **view**: ID of the selection to which the rule belongs
- **disabled**: boolean value whether the rule is disabled / not used to match profiles
- **inversed**: boolean value whether this is an inversed rule, meaning that profiles are included in the rule if they do *not* match the rule
- **conditions**: array of conditions in the rule.

A rule on its own contains *conditions*. For a profile to match a rule, it 
has to match all the conditions. The *conditions* property that is returned
by this method holds an array of condition objects, with the following 
properties per condition:

- **ID**: numeric ID of the condition
- **type**: condition type
- **rule**: numeric ID of the rule to which the condition belongs

Based on the condition type, specific properties are set. For an overview
of the supported conditions and the properties that they support, check

## PHP example

The following script can be used to fetch the properties of rule 12 inside
selection 1234:

    // dependencies
    require_once('copernica_rest_api.php');
    
    // change this into your access token
    $api = new CopernicaRestApi("your-access-token");

    // do the call, and print result
    print_r($api->get("view/1234/rule/12"));

You need the [CopernicaRestApi class](./rest-php.md) to run the example.
