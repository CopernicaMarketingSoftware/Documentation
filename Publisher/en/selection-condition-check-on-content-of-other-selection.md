It is possible to make a reference from one selection to another. This
way you can include or exclude all profiles from another selection in
your current selection.

Use this selection condition to:

-   only include profiles that also appear in a different selection
-   exclude all profiles from a different selection.

Theory in practice:

You have a selection with duplicate profiles. You would like to
automatically exclude those duplicates from the selection where you are
sending your newsletter to.

-   Add a new AND condition to current selection and select the
    condition type: check on content of other selection
-   Choose the selection containing the dubplicate profiles
-   Select the condition "All profiles that do not appear in the other
    selection'

Note: Avoid making too many references. Too many of these references
will seriously slow down the selections\
