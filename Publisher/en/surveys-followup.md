# Surveys: Follow-ups for surveys

Survey follow-ups are the response to the submission of a survey. You
can automate campaigns by adding follow-up actions this way, just like
with e-mailings. The function is found in **Content** under the survey menu.

## Cause and action

A follow-up action consist of two parts: the cause and the action. When
creating a new follow-up action, you are first asked to choose the
cause.

You can choose from 2 different causes for the survey follow-up action:

-   **The survey has been sent**: activate follow-up when the participant
    completed and submitted the survey
-   **A specific answer has been given**: the participant completed the
    survey and gave specific answer(s)

-   **Delay**: the follow-up action can be executed directly (set: 0
    minutes) or after the period you specify here (for example, one week
    later).
-   **Action:** The actual follow-up action. Choose what should happen
    if the follow-up action is triggered. This may be sending an email
    to the profile or something else.

## Additional conditions for the follow-up actions

Sometimes you want to prevent that a follow-up action is scheduled or
executed. For example, the follow-up should only be scheduled when
survey participant is a customer, not a supplier. Or to prevent that a
follow-up email is not sent to people who have unsusbcribed in the
meantime.

There can be days, weeks, or even years between the scheduling and the
actual execution of a follow-up action. Therefore we differentiate
between **schedule conditions** and **action conditions**.

-   Create a **schedule condition** to ensure that the follow-up action
    will be scheduled under certain conditions only
-   Create an **action condition** to ensure that the follow-up action
    is executed under certain conditions only
