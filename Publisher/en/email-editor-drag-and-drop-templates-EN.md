# Drag-and-drop templates

Drag-and-drop templates make designing emails quick and easy. Draggable blocks enable you to determine the location of text, images and buttons. You can create 
a drag-and-drop template in the **['Email editor'](https://ms.copernica.com/en#/design)** by selecting **'Create'**, **'Create drag-and-drop template'**.

Drag-and-drop templates utilize four key elements:

[Email editor elements](../images/nl/Email-editor-elements.png)

**Line**

Each template uses at least one line element (red). Other elements can be incorporated within it. 
Adding multiple line elements will allow you to apply several background colors across the width of your template. 
You can then specify the background color for each individual element.

**Structure and container**

A structure element (blue) consist of one or more containers (orange). The width of structure elements corresponds 
to the width specified for the email itself. When adding structure elements, you can select the number of 
containers that should be used within the element.

**Block**

You can use one or more blocks (green) within a container, for example when adding an image, text or button. 
The various block options are discussed below.

## How the editor works

The editor is divided into two parts: (1) settings and (2) a preview of your email template. 
The settings themselves are divided into two parts (appearance and content).

### Appearance

General settings that determine the look of your email can be configured here. Examples of this 
include the width, font, background color and line spacing used within your template.
You can also configure specific settings that determine the way in which emails are displayed on mobile.

### Content

The content of your email template is added here.

## Structures

As described above, you can specify the structure of your email under **'Structures'**. Emails are assembled 
by adding multiple structure elements below one another. These elements consist of one or more containers. 
Multiple blocks can be added within those containers.

For example, selecting two containers will allow you to add one or more text fields on the left-hand side 
and an image on the right-hand side. Elements that utilize a single container will fill the entire width of your email.

You can manage specific settings by clicking on the structure element within your template. Examples of this include 
adjusting the width of your container within an element or tweaking the padding between multiple containers.

## Blocks

There are several block options available for use in your emails:

|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Menu                  | Option to add menus                                                                                     |
| HTML                  | Option to add your own HTML and CSS                                                                     |


Each block offers its own options for adjusting the way in which emails are displayed.

## Modules

Modules allow you to reuse elements across multiple templates. This ensures that you won't need to perform specific actions repeatedly. 
Modules may utilize line-, structure- or container elements. For example, you can save your header or footer as a module and add it to 
all your templates with one simple action.

You can create a module by hovering over the element and clicking on the three dots. Here you'll find the option **'Save as module'**. 
Saved modules are visible under **'Modules'**.

A name, description and tags can be added to a saved module by hovering over it and clicking on the three dots. 
You'll then be able to search for specific values within your module.
