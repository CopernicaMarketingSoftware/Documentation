# The Follow-Up Manager for Marketing Suite

With this user friendly tool, you can easily create advanced and powerful follow up actions for your campaigns. 
This tool is fully integrated within the template editor so you can easily make personal and advanced 
follow up actions within the Marketing Suite. You can use the Follow-Up Manager if you select an element 
that can also be a link, like for example a button, video or image. The follow up actions only work when 
a destination link is specified. 

You can make a follow up action in two ways, throughout the flowchart editor but also with a script editor. 

# Flowchart editor

Within the flowchart editor you can create advanced follow up and marketing campaigns. With some boxes, you 
can add some extra functionality with Javascript. You can find the available objects 
[here](followups-scripting). The flowchart editor is designed to make advanced campaigns 
with a clear start and endpoint.

# Script editor

With the script editor, you can add javascript and use [these objects](followups-scripting). 
The scripts are executed (like the flowchart editor) on our servers after the receiver 
of the email clicked on a link.
