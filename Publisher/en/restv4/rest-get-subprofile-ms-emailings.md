# REST API: GET subprofile emailings (Marketing Suite)

A method to request a list of all mailings sent from Marketing Suite to a 
specific subprofile. This is an HTTP GET call to the following address:

`https://api.copernica.com/v4/subprofile/{$subprofileID}/ms/emailings`

Don't forget to replace `{$subprofileID}` by the ID of the subprofile you 
want to retrieve the emailings for.

## Available parameters

## Returned fields

The method returns a JSON object containing the following information for each mailing:

* **id**: The ID of the mailing.
* **timestamp**: Timestamp of the mailing.
* **template**: The ID of the template that was used to send the mailing.

entities above it (for example the database a collection belongs to).

### JSON example

The JSON object will contain a property 'data' with an array containing all 
the emailings. The JSON for a single emailing looks something like this:

```json
Array
(
    [id] => 139
    [timestamp] => 2015-01-13 15:09:49
    [template] => 519
    [subject] => Test
    [from_address] => Array
        (
            [name] => Copernica
            [email] => support@copernica.com
        )

    [destinations] => 5
    [type] => mass
    [target] => Array
        (
            [type] => database
            [sources] => Array
                (
                    [0] => Array
                        (
                            [id] => 7078
                            [type] => database
                        )

                    [1] => Array
                        (
                            [id] => 7616
                            [type] => database
                        )

                )

        )

)
```

## PHP Example

The following script demonstrates how to use this method. Because we use the 
CopernicaRestApi class, you don't have to worry about escaping special characters 
in the URL; it is done automatically.

```php
// dependencies
require_once('copernica_rest_api.php');

// change this into your access token
$api = new CopernicaRestAPI("your-access-token", 4);

// do the call, and print result
print_r($api->get("subprofile/{$subprofileID}/ms/emailings", array()));
```

The example above requires the [CopernicaRestApi class](./rest-php).
