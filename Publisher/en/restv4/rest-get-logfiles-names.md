# REST API: GET logfiles names

Copernica keeps logfiles about several things such as clicks, opens, errors, 
accepted messages, etc. These logfiles can be downloaded with the API.
By sending an HTTP GET request to the following URL you will get a list of
all log files for a particular date.

`https://api.copernica.com/v4/logfiles?access_token=xxxx&date=$date&type=$type`

In the URL you can add the `$date` parameter to search for logfiles for a 
specific date. You can also add `$type` to specify a specific type of 
logfile, like cdm-attempts (attempts for Marketing Suite). You can also 
use both. Using neither will return the [logfile dates](./rest-get-logfiles.md)

## Returned fields

## PHP Example

The following PHP script demonstrates how to use the API method. Don't forget 
to substitute the date in the URL (YYYY-MM-DD format).

```php
// dependencies
require_once('copernica_rest_api.php');
    
// change this into your access token
$api = new CopernicaRestAPI("your-access-token", 4);

// the array used to specify the date and/or type
$parameters = array(
    'type' =>     "cdm-attempts",
    'date' =>     "2019-01-01",
);

// do the call, and print result
print_r($api->get("logfiles", $parameters));
```

The example above requires the [CopernicaRestApi class](rest-php).
