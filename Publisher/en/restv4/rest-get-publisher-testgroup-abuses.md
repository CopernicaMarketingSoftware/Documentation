# REST API: GET abuses (Publisher testgroup)

Each emailing is tracked, which allows Copernica to provide you with 
emailing statistics. These are particularly useful in the case of testgroups 
to compare their results. Abuses are one of these statistics. You can 
retrieve the abuses for a testgroup by sending an HTTP GET call to the following URL:

`https://api.copernica.com/v4/publisher/testgroup/$id/abuses?access_token=xxxx`

Where the `$id` should be replaced with the ID of the testgroup.

## Returned fields

The method returns a JSON object with several abuses under the 'data' field. 
For each abuse the following information is available:

* **ID**: ID of the abuse.
* **timestamp**: Timestamp of the abuse.
* **recognized_as**: What the abuse was recognized as ('arf', 'JMR', 'none').
* **feedback_type**: The type of feedback for the abuse ('abuse', 'dkim', 'fraud', 'miscategorized', 'not-spam', 'opt-out' or 'other')
* **arf_version**: Version of the ARF protocol used for this abuse.
* **details**: The abuse report (if available).
* **emailing**: ID of the emailing.
* **destination**: ID of the destination.
* **profile**: ID of the profile.
* **subprofile**: ID of the subprofile (if applicable)

### JSON example

A single abuse might look something like this:

```json
{  
   "ID":"2",
   "timestamp":"2009-12-01 10:00:00",
   "recognized_as":"arf",
   "feedback_type":"opt-out",
   "arf_version":"0.1",
   "details":"",
   "emailing":"613",
   "destination":"60716",
   "profile":"2231853",
   "subprofile":null
}
```

## PHP example

This script demonstrates how to use this API method:

```php
// dependencies
require_once('copernica_rest_api.php');

// change this into your access token
$api = new CopernicaRestAPI("your-access-token", 4);

// execute the call
print_r($api->get("publisher/testgroup/{$testgroupID}/abuses/", $parameters));
```

This example requires the [REST API class](./rest-php).
