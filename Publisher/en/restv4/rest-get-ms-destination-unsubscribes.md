# REST API: GET destination unsubscribes (Marketing Suite)

Each emailing is tracked, which allows Copernica to provide you with 
emailing statistics. Unsubscribes are one of these statistics. You can 
retrieve all unsubscribes for a specific destination by sending an HTTP GET call to the following URL:

`https://api.copernica.com/v4/ms/destination/{$destinationID}/unsubscribes`

## Parameters

The following optional parameters are available:

* **begintime**: The timestamp after which the unsubscribe must have occurred (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format).
* **endtime**: The timestamp before which the unsubscribe must have occurred (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format).
* **unique**: Only retrieve the unique unsubscribes (true / **false**)

Bold is the default value


## Returned fields

The method returns a JSON object with several unsubscribe clicks. For each unsubscribe 
the following information is available:

* **ID**: The ID of the unsubscribe.  
* **mailing**: The ID of the mailing.
* **timestamp**: Timestamp of the unsubscribe.
* **destination**: The ID of the destinations that unsubscribed.
* **source**: Source of the unsubscribe.

## PHP example

This script demonstrates how to use this API method:

```php
// dependencies
require_once('copernica_rest_api.php');

// change this into your access token
$api = new CopernicaRestAPI("your-access-token", 4);

// execute the call
print_r($api->get("ms/destination/{$destinationID}/unsubscribes"));
```

This example requires the [REST API class](./rest-php).
