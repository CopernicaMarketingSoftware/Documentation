# REST API: POST database view

In order to create a new selection using the REST API, you need to send 
an HTTP POST request to the following URL. The selection will then be 
created, nested underneath the database.

`https://api.copernica.com/v4/database/$id/views`

In this, `$id` should be replaced by the numerical identifier, the ID, of 
the database you want to add a selection to. The name of the selection 
is not in the URL, as it needs to be added to the message body of the 
HTTP request. After a successful call the ID of the created request is returned.

## Available parameters

The following variables can be added to the body of the HTTP POST call:

- **name**: The name of the selection that is to be created. (mandatory)
- **description**: an optional description of the new selection.
  
## JSON example

The following JSON demonstrates how to use the API method:

```json
{
  "name": "my-selection",
  "description": "example selection"
}
```

## PHP example

The following PHP example demonstrates how to use the API method:

```php
// dependencies
require_once('copernica_rest_api.php');

// change this into your access token
$api = new CopernicaRestAPI("your-access-token", 4);

// data to pass to the call
$data = array(
    'name'          =>  'my-selection',
    'description'	=> 'example selection',
    'has-rules'	    => False
);

// do the call
$api->post("database/{$databaseID}/views", $data);

// return id of created request if successful
```

The example above requires the [CopernicaRestApi class](rest-php).
