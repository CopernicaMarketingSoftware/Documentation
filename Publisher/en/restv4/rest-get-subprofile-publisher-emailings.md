This is an HTTP GET call to the following address:

want to retrieve the emailings for.

                )

        )

)
```

## PHP Example

The following script demonstrates how to use this method. Because we use the 
CopernicaRestApi class, you don't have to worry about escaping special characters 
in the URL; it is done automatically.

```php
// dependencies
require_once('copernica_rest_api.php');

// change this into your access token
$api = new CopernicaRestAPI("your-access-token", 4);

// parameters to pass to the call
$parameters = array(
    'limit'                 => 10,
    'include_subprofiles'   => 'yes',
    'type'                  => 'mass',
    'followups'             => 'no',
    'registerclicks'        => 'yes',
);

// do the call, and print result
print_r($api->get("subprofile/{$subprofileID}/publisher/emailings", $parameters));
```

The example above requires the [CopernicaRestApi class](./rest-php).
