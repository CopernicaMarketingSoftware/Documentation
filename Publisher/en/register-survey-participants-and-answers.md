If you want to record who fills out the survey and what answers where
given by them, you can send them an email in which you invite them to
participate. In the email you refer to the survey with a personalized
hyperlink.

For example, if your survey is published on
*http://www.yourcompany.com/survey*

Use the following link:

**Mailing to profiles:**

http://www.yourcompany.com/survey*?profile={\$profile.id}&code={\$profile.code}*\

**Mailing to subprofiles:**

http://www.yourcompany.com/survey*?subprofile={\$subprofile.id}&code={\$subprofile.code}*

After the participant completed the survey, you can lookup his or her
answers at the tab surveys at the profile of the participant.
