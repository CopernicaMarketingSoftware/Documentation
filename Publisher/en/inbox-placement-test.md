# Inbox placement test
Besides regular email statistics, Copernica offers another way of gaining insight in your mailings called an 
Inbox Placement Test. This test checks your deliverability in different clients without sending a mailing to 
your 'real' subscribers. This functionality in Copernica is made possible by 
[250ok](https://250ok.com/email-deliverability/seedlist-based-inbox-monitoring-right-way/).

## Weighted seedlist
This test uses a weighted seedlist that is based off your account. 
This seedlist consists of automatically monitored email addresses in the same proportions of email clients 
(like Hotmail, Gmail, etc.) as the profiles in your account. An email document of your choice is sent to the 
seedlist and the deliverability results are published in a report. This whole process takes about an hour, after
which you'll have an idea of the clients your emails get delivered to smoothly, and for which clients your 
deliverability could use some work.  

## Where to find
The inbox delivery test is available in both Publisher and Marketing Suite. In Publisher, 
you'll find it under *Document* in the *Emailings* tab and in Marketing Suite it's under *Tools* in the 
*Email Designer*. For now, the results of the test are only visible in Marketing Suite.  

Note that you will be charged for an inbox placement test.
