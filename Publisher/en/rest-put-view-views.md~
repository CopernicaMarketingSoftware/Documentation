# REST API: editing nested selections

Copernica supports nested selections. To edit a nested selection you can send a HTTP GET request to the following URL:

'https://api.copernica.com/view/$id/views?access_token=xxxx'

The first $id needs to be replaced by the numerical identifier of the upper selection and the second $id by the lower selection.
