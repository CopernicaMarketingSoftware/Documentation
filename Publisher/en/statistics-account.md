# Statistics: Account statistics

The account statistics provide information about how your Copernica 
account is being used to communicate. This is not the same as the 
[overall account mailing statistics](./statistics-account-mailings).

## Publisher 

You can find the statistics under the **Admin** tab. Select a user and go 
to the statistics tab. Under this tab you can find information about 
the amount of mails, fax messages and sms messages sent. You can also find 
information about the amount of created web pages, the amount of API calls and 
the amount of email previews from the account. All of this is displayed 
per month and also visualized in a graph.
