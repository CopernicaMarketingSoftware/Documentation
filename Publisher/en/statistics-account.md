# Statistics: Account statistics

The account statistics provide information about how your Copernica 
account is being used to communicate. This is not the same as the 
[overall account mailing statistics](./statistics-account-mailings).

## Marketing Suite

To find your account usage you can go to your account. You now see several 
options, including the option to view the usage of your account. Here you 
find the amount of messages sent, API calls fired and hosted webpages. 
On the right side of the screen there is also a button to download the 
statistics as a PDF.

## Publisher 

You can find the statistics under the **Admin** tab. Select a user and go 
to the statistics tab. Under this tab you can find information about 
the amount of mails, fax messages and sms messages sent. You can also find 
information about the amount of created web pages, the amount of API calls and 
the amount of email previews from the account. All of this is displayed 
per month and also visualized in a graph.
