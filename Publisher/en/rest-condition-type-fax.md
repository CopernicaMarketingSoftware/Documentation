# REST API: Condition type fax

Conditions have different types of properties. Some concern the timeframe in 
which something happened (date properties), others concern mailing information 
(mailing properties) and others concern just the specific type of condition 
(individual properties). This article is about the properties of the 
fax condition.

## Date properties
* **before-time**: Matches only profiles that received the document before this time
* **after-time**: Matches only profiles that received the document after this time
* **before-mutation**: Datemutation (time difference) for mails sent too early.
* **after-mutation**: Datemutation (time difference) for mails sent too late.

## Mailing properties

"match_profiles_that_received_something", "match_profiles_that_received_document", 
"match_profiles_that_received_nothing", "match_profiles_that_received_not_document"
* **required-destination**: The destination of the mailing. Possible values: 
"profile", "subprofile", anything"
* **document**: Name of the document used for matchmode (only if set to 
"match_profiles_that_received_document", "match_profiles_that_received_not_document")
* **template**: The name of the template of the condition.
* **number**: The required number of messages that are received by the recipient.
