# Optimizing selections

In Copernica, selections are maintained actively, which means they are rebuilt multiple times a day to keep them updated. This is part of why Copernica is so powerful: all users have to to is specify the conditions for a selection, and Copernica sorts profiles automatically. Active filters do take up some computing power. If your filters are too heavy or you have too many, it can negatively affect your database performance. Organizing a database well makes it perform better and faster. Below, we'll show you how to achieve that.

### Delete and conquer

Even when you don't use a selection, it is kept active. Therefore, it's 
better to delete unused selections, as to not waste any computing power. 
Do you have selections that you don't use, but do plan on using again? 
Then it's a good idea to deactivate them until you start using them again. 
More information on deleting and deactivating selections can be found 
[here](selections-settings).

The same goes for databases: some users make new databases for every 
mailing they send. Although we discourage this - it's better to do 
everything within one database - we don't prohibit it either. If you 
want to organize your profiles in such a way, make sure to delete the 
databases after a while.

### Only filter what you really need

Don't over-filter: delete selection conditions you don't need to achieve 
your goal. The more filtering, the longer it takes to build the selection. 
Also make sure you don't have any duplicate conditions. 

### Be smart about indexing

An indexed field is filtered in a smarter way. Normally Copernica goes 
through a database column alphabetically, but in an indexed field 
Copernica can more or less determine up front where the information 
you're looking for is. That way, it doesn't have to go through the 
entire thing.

While being very useful, indexing fields can also backfire: indexing too 
many fields makes your database slower as a whole. It's best to only 
index fields you use to sort, numerical fields and fields you use for 
field conditions (field X equals field Y). 
The 'index this field' option can be found in the field options under 
*database management*.

### Start out easy

Some selections are heavier than others. Simply looking through 
numerical fields is done way quicker than filtering based on feedback 
from emails. Therefore, it's a good idea to use subselections for heavy 
operations.

Say, you've got a database of 100.000 profiles in which you want to make 
a selection of active customers born in 1980 and who have had at least 
three registered impressions in the past year. This takes up a lot of 
power, especially if Copernica has to go through 100.000 profiles for 
each condition.

Here's where subselections come in. Start out with a selection that 
checks for people born in 1980. It's an easy selection, and it filters 
out a lot of people. Then, underneath the selection, make a subselection 
that checks for email results in the past year. You now only have to 
search through hundreds, maybe a couple thousand profiles instead of 
100.000, making it a lighter operation.

Light selection conditions are:
- Searching for field values such as 'X equals Y'
- Checking for interests
- Checking for dates on date fields

Heavy ones are:
- Sort or select profiles
- Check for campaign results
- Check for changes in the profile
- Check for unique/duplicate profiles

### Grouping selections using an empty selection

To create visual clarity in a database, many users use empty parent 
selections to group selections together. This is a good idea, but you 
shouldn't use an active selection condition, such as 'the value "ID" 
should be higher than 0', because then you're making useless calculations. 
It's better to set up a condition, and then deactivate it. That way, 
you're not computing anything and you still have a selection containing 
all profiles.

### Use the right field types

Using the right field types enables Copernica to use the right searching 
tactics, making it faster. Save numbers in numerical fields, dates in 
date fields, et cetera.
When using text fields, make them as short as possible by setting the 
max length to exactly the amount of characters you need. For example, 
if you're using a text field for Dutch postal codes, set it to 6 
characters (Dutch postal codes consist of four digits, followed by two 
letters). The shorter the text, the faster the search.

### Selections with references

Only refer to other selections if there's no other way. When a selection 
depends on 10 other selections, those 10 others need to be built first, 
which takes time. At times, it may be needed and that's okay, but if 
there's any way to avoid it, do so. 

### Avoid selections based on email campaigns

Selecting based on email campaigns is by far the heaviest condition type. 
It is usually deployed to find and filter hardbounces from other 
selections. It's better to use follow-up actions on the document of the 
mailing to register errors and store it directly in the profile. That 
way, you can create your bounce selection based on a light field type 
check. Although this may not be ideal, it does make your selection a 
lot faster.

### Using the sort/select condition?

Index the fields you sort on, or better yet, don't select fields to sort 
on. In that case, the profile ID is used automatically, which is by far 
the fastest.
