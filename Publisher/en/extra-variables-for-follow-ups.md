# Extra variables for follow-ups

For follow-up actions, extra variables are made available that enable you to recieve information about the action that preceded. This can be usefull for example when you want to make a follow-up action that sends an email to a fixed address containing information about a webform or survey that was submitted. 

Please note that smarty 2 is still being used within follow-up actions. This requires the oldschool foreach syntax to loop through the array. 

### Example: 

<ul>
    {foreach from=$mailing.trigger.fields.interests key=k item=v}
      <li>{$k}: {$v}</li>
    {/foreach}
</ul>
