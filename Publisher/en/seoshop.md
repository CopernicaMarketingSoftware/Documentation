Using the Copernica app for
[SEOshop](http://www.getseoshop.com/?utm_source=partners&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=copernica),
your client data coming from your webstore are automatically
synchronized with your database in Copernica. As such, you will never
need to export and import databases any more.

About the SEOshop app
---------------------

A complete synchronization of all your client data will take place when
you install the application. Thereafter, the application will send the
data of new clients to Copernica every 5 minutes.

The app synchronizes the following client data:

-   SEOshop ID
-   First name
-   Last name
-   Email address
-   Registration date

ATTENTION: In order to install the application, you will need a
[SEOshop](http://www.getseoshop.com/?utm_source=partners&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=copernica)
account and a Copernica account. Furthermore, it's important you [create a
database](https://www.copernica.com/en/support/video-tutorials/profiles-creating-a-database)
within Copernica which you can use to send the client data to. The
necessary columns in your Copernica database, will be generated by the
application. No further action is required.
