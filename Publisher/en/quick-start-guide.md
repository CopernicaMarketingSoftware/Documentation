# Quick start

Before being able to send campaigns in Copernica, there is some setup work
to do. First you have to set up a sender domain so Copernica can send email 
for you. You also have to configure your DNS settings and subdomains. 
After this we'll take care of getting your emails delivered succesfully. 
The second step is to create or import your database. After doing this 
you can make selections and rules to email specific subsets of your database.

After you have completed these steps you can create your first template with 
the very user-friendly template editor inside the Marketing Suite.

Done finishing your template? Good! You are now ready to send your first 
mailing!.
