# Quick start

Before being able to send campaigns in Copernica, there is some setup work. 
First you have to set up a sender domain so Copernica can send email for 
you. You also have to configure your DNS settings and subdomains. 
After this we'll take care of getting your emails delivered succesfully. 
The second step is to create or import your database. After doing this 
you can also make [selections](./selections-introduction) to email 
specific subsets of your database.

After you have completed these steps you can create your first template with 
the very user-friendly Marketing Suite template editor.

After all of these steps you are ready to send your first mailing! 
However, if you want to integrate Copernica data into your own system 
you may want to look into [feedback loops](./feedback-loops) as well. 

## Quick start checklist

To help you out, we've created a small checklist of things you need to
