# Personalization functions: survey

The *survey* function can be used to include a survey in your document 
if you have already created a [survey](./surveys) and supply a valid [XSLT](./css-and-xslt).

## Example

    {survey name="mysurvey" xslt="mystyle"}
    
By including this line you include the survey with the given name in the 
style of the given XSLT.
