# Follow up actions

If someone clicks on a link in a mailing, or when some other kind of event
happens, Copernica can automatically execute or schedule follow up actions.
This allows you to make fancy campaigns that trigger new mailings when
things happen. 

There are even multiple ways how you can configure these
follow-ups. You can configure them in Publisher with a menu editor and 
in Marketing Suite with a script editor for programmers and a simple drag 
and drop editor for marketing specialists.

## Flowchart Editor

Within the flowchart editor you can chain boxes together to create 
advanced follow up- and marketing campaigns. In some boxes you can add 
extra functionality with the use of JavaScript. The available properties 
are the same as those of the script editor and can be [found here](./followups-scripting.md). 
We designed the flowchart editor for marketers to create powerful 
campaigns with a clear beginning and end.

## Script Editor

Programmers can use the full power of Copernica's follow up system with the
[*data-script* attribute](./followups-scripting.md). Every hyperlink in a mail 
can be enriched with a special script that will be executed when the link is 
clicked. This is a very powerful follow-up system because you can write your
own scripts.

## Publisher followups (old)

[Followups in Publisher](./followups-publisher) are always accessible in the menu of the 
selected **database**, **document**, **survey** or **web form**. See the 
link for more information on creating followups in Publisher. The Publisher does not have
a scripting API and is not as powerful as the new systems, but because it has
been around for so many years, it has still evolved into a very powerful tool.
If there is something you don't understand in Marketing Suite or need a tutorial, 
you'll most likely find it here.
