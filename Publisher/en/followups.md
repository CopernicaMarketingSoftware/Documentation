# Follow up actions

If someone clicks on a link in a mailing, or when some other kind of event
happens, Copernica can automatically execute or schedule follow up actions.
This allows you to make fancy campaigns that trigger new mailings when
things happen. There are even multiple ways how you can configure these
follow-ups:

* Using the [follow up manager in the Marketing suite](./follow-up-manager.md).
* With the [data-script attribute](./followups-scripting.md) if you are a programmer yourself.
* Or with the [old follow up system of Copernica Publisher](./followups-publisher.md)


## The follow up manager inside the drag-and-drop editor

We are currently very busy with developing a new follow up manager inside our
drag-and-drop editor. This is a new tool that allows you to use your mouse
to connect each link or button in a mailing to a follow-up action. If you want
to update a profile when someone clicks a link, or if you want send a new 
mailing, you can easily set this up with the [follow up manager](./follow-up-manager.md).


## The data-script attribute

Programmers can use the full power of Copernica's follow up system with the
[*data-script* attribute](./followups-scripting.md). Every hyperlink in a mail 
can be enriched with a special script that will be executed when the link is 
clicked. This is a very powerful follow-up system because you can write your
own scripts.


## Old Publisher follow-ups

If you're still using Publisher for your mailings, you can also use Publisher's
old [follow up tool](./followups-publisher.md). The Publisher does not have
a scripting API and is not as powerful as the new systems, but because it has
been around for so many years, it has still evolved into a very powerful tool.
