# The Follow-up manager

Marketing automation is a favorite subject of many marketeers. Follow-ups in Copernica 
can automatically execute or schedule actions based on triggers, making them 
a great way to automate your campaigns. You can design your own 
fancy campaigns, for example to send an email when someone clicks on a  
link, or to congratulate someone on their birthday.

There are several different ways to do this with Copernica software. If you 
are new to automating campaigns the easiest way to create follow-ups is with 
the user-friendly drag 'n drop editor in the Marketing Suite. Programmers 
can use the advanced script editor in the Marketing Suite and Publisher offers 
a menu editor.

## Follow-Up Manager (Marketing Suite)

Within the [flowchart editor](./follow-up-manager-ms) you can chain boxes 
together to create advanced campaigns using followups. It has been specifically 
designed with marketeers in mind. If you have Javascript programming experience 
the advanced mode can also be a really powerful tool, as it allows you to 
define your own logic.

## Follow-Up Manager (Publisher)

[Follow-ups in Publisher](./follow-up-manager-publisher) are always accessible 
in the menu of the selected **database**, **document**, **survey** or **web form**. 
Follow-ups are created by combining a trigger and an action in the menu editor. 
The Publisher does not have a scripting API.

## Script Editor

Programmers can use the full power of Copernica's follow up system with the
[*data-script* attribute](./followups-scripting.md). You can enrich 
every hyperlink in an email, for example, to handle clicks exactly how you 
want.

## More information

There are many ways to create follow-ups, so you can try which editor 
works better for you. You can also use both, but it is recommended that you 
don't create duplicate follow-ups. The articles below provide more information 
on how follow-ups work.
