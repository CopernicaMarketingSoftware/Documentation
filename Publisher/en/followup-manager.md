# Followup manager

The followup manager is an easy tool to create entire campaigns. Because this tool is integrated with the template editor can be designed directly sophisticated and personal follow-up actions within the editor. The followup manager you can use when someone clicks on an element, such as a link, image, video, or other call-to-action.

You navigate to the followup manager by selecting a CTA in the template editor where you want to make a follow-up action. A follow-up action can make in two ways, with the flowchart editor and script editor.

## Flowchart Editor

Within the flowchart editor you can chain different boxes together to create advanced followup- and marketing campaigns. In some boxes you can add extra functionality with JavaScript. The available properties can be [found here](./followups-scripting.md). We designed the flowchart editor for marketers to create powerful campaigns with a clear beginning and end.

## Script Editor

The script editor you can use in addition to the flowchart editor. These scripts are (like in the flowchart editor) executed on our servers. The available properties that can be used can be [found here](./followups-scripting.md).
