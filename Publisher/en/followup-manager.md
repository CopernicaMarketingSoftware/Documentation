# Followup manager

The followup manager is an easy tool to create campaigns. This tool is integrated with the template editor and can be used to make sophisticated and personal follow-up actions within the editor. You can use the followup manager when someone clicks on an element, such as a link, image, video, or an other call-to-action.

You navigate to the followup manager by selecting a CTA in the template editor, where you want to make a follow-up action. You can make a follow-up action in two ways, with the flowchart editor and script editor.

## Flowchart Editor

Within the flowchart editor you can chain boxes together to create advanced followup- and marketing campaigns. In some boxes you can add extra functionality with the use of JavaScript. The available properties can be [found here](./followups-scripting.md). We designed the flowchart editor for marketers to create powerful campaigns with a clear beginning and end.

## Script Editor

The script editor can be used in addition of the flowchart editor. These scripts are (like in the flowchart editor) executed on our servers. The available properties that can be used can be [found here](./followups-scripting.md).
