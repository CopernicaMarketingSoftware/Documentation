# SOAP API

Besides the existing integrations 
for different systems, with our powerful SOAP API you are able to create
an integration with your own software. Synchronize all data from
Copernica with the data from your own software to keep all information
and your marketing campaigns up to date.

Copernica also supports a REST API. You can find more information about it 
[here](./rest-api "REST-API").

## Copernica's SOAP API

Copernica's SOAP API uses the SOAP standard. This means you'll be able
to integrate the API in development environments as Java Netbeans and
Microsoft Visual Studio. By using the SOAP standard, programmers will
quickly be able to start working with Copernica. Also, the API can be
invoked from every standard programming language and development
environment.

## Full control with Copernica's object model

Copernica's API uses a logical and structured object model. All data in
the software is represented by objects. Read the properties of these
objects with SOAP API and then update them. The methods can also be
invoked. Every project is built up from smaller sub-objects. An object
that represents a database for example, has a method that requests all 
documents that were created based on this template.

## Use Copernica functionalities in the application

The power of API is that all functionalities that can be executed in
Copernica's user interface, can also be used in another application if
you use the SOAP API. Use the API to build up databases for instance, or
to create relation profiles, to create templates or to produce email
documents.

## Renewed callback system

By synchronizing data between Copernica and an external location or
database, you don't have to keep importing 
data manually from Copernica and vice versa. Both systems do this fully
automatically. In Copernica, one can easily set up callback URLs.
Copernica will use this to keep the third party application informed
about all changes in the database of Copernica.
