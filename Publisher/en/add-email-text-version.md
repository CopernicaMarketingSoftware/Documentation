A text version of the HTML document can be sent along with your
e-mailing for e-mail clients that do not support HTML. Recipients at
these e-mail clients will be shown the text version, rather than an
empty e-mail.

Sending a text version along with your document also improves your
deliverability!

You can create a text version in the tab *Text version*, found directly
above the email document or template.

You can enter a text version manually on the tab or write a default text
version for all documents on template level. For document text versions
you have the option to '*filter text from HTML*'. This will
automatically include the text from your text blocks in the text
version. Always double check the text version when you're using the
filter option.

Of course, a text version can be personalized too.

**Change editor view**\
 You can change the view on the text version with the 'change editor
view' option in the preview below. One type of editor will show numbered
lines and colours, the other a flat text.
