# Surveys: Question options

There are several [question types](./surveys-question-types) with different 
extra options. The following options are available:

* **Optional**: Check this box if the question may be skipped by the
participant. Otherwise he/she will be obliged to fill in an answer
before his/her survey can be submitted.
* **Starts on new page**: Check this box if this question should
start on a new web page. There will be a submit button added after
the last question before this one and the questions before will not be
displayed again on the next page where this question starts.
* **Display**: This option is only shown for multiple choice questions. 
You can either select **checkboxes** to allow multiple answers or **selectbox** 
to allow only one answer.
