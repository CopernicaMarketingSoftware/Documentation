A/B testing: test everything
----------------------------

![A/B testing: test
everything](../images/nl-a-b-split-test-copernica.gif "A/B testing: test everything")

With an A/B test, you send two or more versions of the same email. How
many versions you use, depends on the factor that you're testing. And
with Copernica, you can test almost anything you want:

-   The subject line, the text in your pre-header, “From” field etc.
-   The content of your email, for example hyperlinks or [RSS
    feeds](./rss-and-atom-feeds.md "RSS or Atom feed").
-   The [design of your
    email](./create-custom-templates.md "Create custom templates"):
    layout, images, positioning.
-   The call to action: shape and size of your call to action.
-   [Personalisation](./create-clever-emailings.md "Create clever emailings"):
    are you using the right personalisation for your target audience?

You decide the number of emails Copernica sends and the amount of
recipients in your A/B test group. Copernica will automatically send the
most successful version of your email to the rest of your contacts.

Test the way your email is displayed
------------------------------------

![Test the way your email is

Would you like to test the way your email is displayed in various email
programs before it’s sent? Do you want to make sure it looks right in
Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo!, Outlook and all other email clients? Thats no
problem with Copernica.

Because of the [integration of
Litmus](http://www.copernica.com/en/support/integrations/litmus "Litmus integration"),
you can preview your newsletter and see what it’ll look like in various
browsers and email clients. This functionality will help you optimise
your email and prevent annoying mistakes.

Copernica's checks
------------------

At Copernica we know how important it is that your emails are delivered
successfully. That’s why we built our software to check:

-   If the IP address you use to send emails is on a blacklist.
-   The possible spam score of your email.
-   If your HTML source contains any errors.
-   If there are elements in your CSS style sheet that the software
    can’t convert to inline CSS attributes.
-   If you’re using the right authentication data (SPF and DKIM).

Our checks are firm but fair. They protect your sender reputation and
ensure better delivery of your emails.
