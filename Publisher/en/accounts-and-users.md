# Accounts and users

It's perfectly possible that at a certain point in time you want to
modify your details. For example your company name or login 
credentials. This can all be done in the user management section of
the Marketing Suite. At the same time, you can also create new
accounts and decide who has access to which account.

Copernica works together with a close-knit network of partners. So
the interface is built exactly for that purpose. Many of our 
partners support other users to employ Copernica in their company.
All these partners each have different requirements to access the 
software. For example, it's not unusual for a partner to be called 
into action to watch along with an existing Copernica user that 
wants to use the service of an external specialist. In the user 
management section, you therefore find the pre-defined categories:
"users", "accounts" and "companies". 

* User is allowed to get access to the API;
* User is allowed to get access to the user management interface;
* User becomes admin of an account;
* User becomes curator of the corporate identity.

In the figure below you'll find the triangular relationship, which
illustrates the possibility for all the constructions you can set 
up. A partner can for example create an account with a Copernica
license. Once created, it's possible that the employees also get 
access to the account. If you want, you can also give an external
person access to a certain account. You create these relations
easily in the user management section, where everything is neatly 
displayed for your convenience.
