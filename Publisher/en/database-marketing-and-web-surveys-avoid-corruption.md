# Prevent corruption in database marketing

When it comes to [database marketing](./database-introduction),
corrupted lists are your worst enemy. Not only should your data be as up
to date as possible, you also want it to be relevant and qualitative.
Because the more irrelevant data you have, the higher the risk of a
corrupted database.

Good database marketing starts with gathering the right information.
[Web surveys](./surveys)
are a great way of enriching your database with relevant data. But there
are some pitfalls you want to avoid. By asking the wrong questions, you
could be gathering irrelevant, or even incorrect data.

To illustrate the issues this can lead to: according to research from
Dun & Bradstreet, in an average database 60 per cent of the files is
corrupted. A nightmare for anyone who works in database marketing. A lot
of companies even turned out to have 35 percent less customers than
they thought.

That’s why you should always maintain a clean database. Starting with
the gathering of correct and relevant data. A few tips for composing a
good web survey:

**Ask the right multiple choice questions**
When composing a survey, a lot of marketers tend to ask multiple
choice questions. A logical choice, since these answers are the easiest
to process automatically in your database. It can also be a very good
decision, as long as you choose your words carefully.

**1.** **Avoid false dilemmas**
Sometimes when filling in an online survey, you stumble onto questions
like: what is your favourite food? Where the possible answers will be
something like: pasta, potatoes and meat. This however is a false
dilemma. With all the different kinds of food in the world, a lot of
your respondents are bound to have other preferences than just one of
these three options. Consider adding a textbox so users can add their own 
answers.

**2.** **Don't be suggestive**
In the example above, even if you add an option like ‘other:’ you
should still be cautious. By suggesting three other possibilities first,
a respondent could unconsciously be steered into choosing one of those
options. In other words: you’ll get incorrect information which
eventually will make you less effective in database marketing.

**3.** **Be careful with answers that don’t exclude each other**
‘Are you satisfied with our services?’ An excellent question to ask in
an online survey. But not very effective if you give respondents the
following options:

-   Yes, I’m satisfied
-   Yes, I would recommend your services to my friends
-   No, I’m not satisfied

Answers 1 and 2 don’t exclude each other. In a case like this, don’t use
radio buttons that only allow someone to choose one option in your
survey. Rather give your respondent the possibility to tick multiple
answers.

**Don’t ask unnecessary questions**
To be able to do database marketing effectively, it’s important to
restrain yourself from  gathering irrelevant information. Is it really
important for a camping material reseller to know how far away their
customers go camping? Or as a tea manufacturer, how significant is it to
know if your target audience rather drinks from cups or mugs?

By asking unnecessary questions, not only are you gathering irrelevant
information and increasing the risk of database corruption, you are also
taking up more of your respondents’ time. So for every additional
question you ask, you increase the risk of a respondent not finishing
the survey.

**Don’t get greedy**
Information is the key to successful database marketing. Relevant data
is what you want, and as much as you can get your hands on. That’s why
as a marketer, you might feel inclined to make all questions in a survey
‘required’.

Respondents however aren’t always able to answer a certain question. Or
sometimes they just don’t want to. By compelling them do so anyway, you
aren’t exactly increasing your chances of getting reliable information.
So if you want to keep your database clean, offer your respondents the
option to skip a question.
