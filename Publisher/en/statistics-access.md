# Account emailing statistics

The account emailing statistics show you the results of all emailings
sent with the account, over a set period of time.

This period of time can be modified in the top right corner of the
account statistics screen. Changing this period of time affects all data
displayed on this page.

The way in which the account statistics are presented is not different
from the other statistics.

To view the account statistics, choose **Account emailing
statistics** from the **Mailings menu**.

**Note: **The account emailing statistics are not the same as the
account statistics. These statistics can be found in the admin section.
