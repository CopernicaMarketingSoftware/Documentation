# Mobile messages in Publisher

Copernica also offers the option to send mobile mailings through fax or 
SMS. SMS messages are easy to compose and even international campaigns are 
possible without extra charges. You can send SMS mailings from the **Mobile** 
menu and fax mailings from the regular **E-mailings** menu.

Tariffs can be found on the [pricing page](https://www.copernica.com/en/pricing).

## SMS mailing

First give the document a descriptive name and (optionally) a description. 
Then choose the version of [Smarty](./smarty-2-vs-smarty-3.md) for 
[personalization](./personalization).

You can now immediately write content and personalize your message. A text 
message can be up to 160 characters long. If your message is longer you 
can choose to split it into multiple messages. Be especially careful 
when you use personalization, because values like names can be longer than 
you expect.

You also have to set the message sender, which is what the recipient will 
see when receiving the message. Set it under the *document* menu. Smarty 
personalization is also allowed in this field.

It is possible to use Copernica for sending mass fax mailings . Sending
a faxmailing is not substantially different from sending a normal mass
mailing .

### Fax mailing

To send a fax you need to have a PDF file of the document you want to fax 
uploaded to Publisher. You also need the fax numbers of the profiles you 
want to send a message. They should be stored in a **FAX** field, which 
you can find under the field type *Phone*. After preparing the mailing 
you can send it to a selection through the mailings menu. 
If you use Smarty [personalization](./personalization) test your document 
thoroughly as always to make sure the receivers see the document as you intended.
