#Quick start
##Setting up the software
Before being able to send campaigns in Copernica, there are a few things you have to do.
You first need to set up the software and update the DNS settings and subdomains of your domain. After that, you need to create or import a database with profiles, create a template and configure a sender domain. You might want to make one or multiple selections to aim your campaigns at certain subsets of your database.

Sounds like a lot, right? Sometimes, that's not even all. Many of our users choose an automated link between their website and Copernica and use feedback loops to integrate data that was acquired by Copernica into their own systems.

We try our best to make our systems so that setting up takes as little effort as possible, but it will always take some time to configure everything exactly to your needs.
