# Surveys: Deleting a survey

To delete a survey go to the Survey menu and click the **Remove** button. 
You will now have to check a checkbox and accept with the button. After 
this a pop-up will appear to ask if you are really super sure. If you press 
"yes" the survey and all its results will be lost forever. If you want to 
keep the results but not accept new results you might want to 
archive the survey or [export the results](./surveys-export-results) before 
deleting.
