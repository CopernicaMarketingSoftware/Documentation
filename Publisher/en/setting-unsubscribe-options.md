# Setting unsubscribe options
Copernica receives all sorts of feedback from users who want to unsubscribe from mailing lists. 
Itâ€™s up to you how you react to unsubscribe triggers: ignore them (bad idea), delete the entire profile or change a 
field value so you know not to send them mailings, but keep the profile data?


Triggers come in different ways. Usually they come in the form of unsubscribe links in mailings and feedback 
from a user clicking the unsubscribe button in their email client. The latter is shown in some clients if a 
list-unsubscribe header is present in the email.


However, there are other triggers besides those two. For example, when we receive a complaint at our abuse address. 
Some email providers have feedback loops that give us a heads up when someone logs an email as spam. 
These types of feedback are caught by Copernia and processed according to your unsubscribe options.

## Where to find
Unsubscribe behaviour can be set for each database individually. The profile management module has an option called 'set unsubscribe behaviour' under the database menu. Click this, and the rest speaks for itself.
