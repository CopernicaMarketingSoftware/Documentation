# REST API: Condition type miniview

Conditions have different types of properties. Some concern the timeframe in 
which something happened (date properties), others concern mailing information 
(mailing properties) and others concern just the specific type of condition 
(individual properties). This article is about the properties of the 
miniview condition.

## Individual properties
* **mini-view**: Miniview associated with condition
* **min-subprofiles**: Minimum number of subprofiles in the miniview
* **max-subprofiles**: Maximum number of subprofiles in the miniview
