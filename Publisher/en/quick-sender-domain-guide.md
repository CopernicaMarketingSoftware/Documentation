# Setting up a sender domain

Mailings can be sent from any address, like newsletter@company.com. This address can be
manually set in Copernica, but to make sure all recipients receive the mail correctly, we advise to
update your DNS settings first before sending mail through Copernica. Simply put: your domain's
DNS settings need to say Copernica is allowed to send mail from your domain. If this is not the
case, chances are many of your messages will not be accepted by recipients' servers.

Copernica Sender Domains are an easy solution for a complicated problem. 
They handle the difficult task of creating correct records for [SPF](./spf), 
[DKIM](./dkim), [DMARC](./dmarc) and subdomains for click, open and bounce tracking. 
Usually you would also have to rotate private keys to prevent them from being 
cracked, but Copernica Sender Domains also habdke this for you.

This article focuses on setting your sender domain 
up appropriately, but you can find more information in the [background on sender domains](./sender-domains) 
article.

## Marketing Suite

The newly designed Marketing Suite interface lets you easily set up your sender-domain.

When you set up your domain as a sender domain, Copernica automatically makes sure your DNS
settings are correct and up-to-date. You won't need to configure anything, domain-wise, after the
initial setup. This means your click, bounce and open domains are set up and your DKIM keys are
rotated automatically. The sender domain settings have priority, even if you choose to only 
send mail through the Publisher.

You'll find the sender-domain tool in the menu under the header *configuration*.

## Top-level domain or subdomain?
Setting up a sender domain requires you to fill in a domain name. This is the domain you're going
to use for the sender address. For example, if you want to use newsletter@company.com, you
register company.com as the sender domain. After that, a number of relevant DNS settings will
automatically be generated by Copernica.
Note that if you already had SPF, DKIM or DMARC settings in the DNS of your domain, you'll
need to transfer these to the sender domain. If you don't want to do this, because you don't know
how or because you're afraid something will go wrong, it's best to use a subdomain. This could be
something like newsletter@campaigns.company.com, or whatever you want it to be. While this
may look less fancy, it is the fastest way to fix the configuration quickly if you want to start
sending mail.

## Validating your domain

To prevent abuse of sender domains, you need to prove that you're really the owner of the domain.
After registering your sender domain, Marketing Suite shows a warning message. You first need to
add a TXT record to your DNS with a code only Copernica can decypher. Only after we've seen
this record in your DNS, we'll believe it's truly your domain. You'll be able to complete your setup
after this.

## DNS settings

As described above, Copernica creates all relevant DNS settings so you don't need to. However,
Copernica cannot implement these settings for you. No one except the domain owner has writing
rights to DNS settings unless the owner explicitly grants permission. The domain owner is the only
one who can add subdomains and records to a DNS. At this point you're probably wondering how
we can do so anyway.

Here's the deal: the DNS settings Copernica sets up and manages are not actually settings for your
domain, but for a subdomain of Copernica itself. The settings we offer in the MarketingSuite are
recommended settings containing aliases that point to Copernica's DNS. You need to copy these to
your DNS so Copernica can manage your domains through our servers (because your subdomain
links to our subdomain).

    Reccomended settings that                DNS records on Copernica's
    need to be added to the DNS:             server, with sender domain
                                             settings:


    +-------------------+                       +-------------------+
    |   SPF alias       |           --->        |   TXT record      |
    +-------------------+                       +-------------------+
    |   DKIM alias      |           --->        |   TXT record      |
    +-------------------+                       +-------------------+
    |   DMARC alias     |           --->        |   TXT record      |
    +-------------------+                       +-------------------+
    |   Tracking alias  |           --->        |   A record(s)     |
    +-------------------+                       +-------------------+
    |   Bounce alias    |           --->        |   MX record(s)    |
    +-------------------+                       +-------------------+
</pre>

After registering and validating your domain and adding the aliases to your DNS, you can start
sending mailings that are properly authenticated and using aligned domains.

## The next step
To send your first mailing, you need a database with profiles to send it to.
