# Surveys: Question types

When composing your survey you can choose from four 'question' types: open
question, multiple choice, grid question or an in-between text.

This article is about the question types. [Were you looking for

## Text between questions

Text between questions is given the same space as a question, but has no
answering option. It is mostly used to add introductory headers to
questions or divisions between topics. If you want to expand on a question it 
is recommended to do so in the underwriting when making a question. (see 
[create a new survey](./surveys.md))

## Open questions

An open question allows the participant to type in an answer through
free text. After saving the question you will see the extra option to limit the
number of lines the participant will see to fill out their answer.

## Multiple-choice questions

A multiple choice question offers the participant a select number of
answering possibilities. After saving the question you will see several
options for these choices.

The multiple choice answers can be displayed as **select boxes**, which
will show a drop down menu with an arrow on the side. The user can select 
only one answer.
Multiple choice answers can also be displayed as **checkboxes**, which 
will display square checkboxes that can be checked or unchecked to answer 
the question. Conventionally these are used to allow multiple answers, but 
you can still choose to allow only one answer.

The answering options can be entered and moved around in a separate tab. 
If you want to allow the user to type their own answer in text you can click 
"Other, namely" to add a text box to the end of the checkbox list.

and the textbox to add their own option.*

To have one of the multiple choice options already checked for the
respondent, add a \\\* to that option (before or after text). The \\\* will
be visible in the text and the checkbox will already be checked.

## Grid questions

A grid offers the participant several answers in a range. An example range would 
be bad/neutral/good or 1/2/3/4/5. These questions are particularly useful for 
measuring the opinion of a customer. After saving the question the extra options 
appear.

- Choose if the questions is horizontal or vertical.
- A vertical lining means that only one answer from each column can be
chosen. A horizontal lining is to choose answers per row (most common for scaling).
- On a separate tab you may enter the answering options and variables. 
Add rows and columns. You may also change their order and/or position in the options.
