The Microsoft Dynamics CRM integration enables a connection between your
stored data in Microsoft Dynamics CRM2011 and your database in
Copernica. This connection will give you the possibility to directly
create marketing campaigns based on data in Microsoft Dynamics CRM. With
the integration between Microsoft Dynamics and Copernica you can easily
automate and personalize your own marketing campaigns.

About Microsoft Dynamics CRM
----------------------------

The Microsoft Dynamics CRM integration is currently still in a test
phase. If you'd like to experience the working of this integration, you
can request for a beta test. If you choose to use the beta test version
of the integration, you will be able to use the integration for free for
6 months. When these 6 months are over, our partner Triomis will create
a license.

When applying for a beta test, please provide us with the following
details:

-   Your Dynamics account number (found in Dynamics, under
    CustomerSource)
-   Name of your organization (found in Dynamics, under customization
    -\> developer resources)

After requesting a beta test, an employee of our partner Triomis will
contact you as soon as possible.

*This Copernica integration is developed by a third party. Copernica is
not responsible for the performance of this integration.*
