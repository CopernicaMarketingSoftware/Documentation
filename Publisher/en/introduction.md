# Introduction

Copernica develops multiple email-related products like 
[MailerQ](https://www.mailerq.com) and [SMTPeter](https://www.smtpeter.com).
However, Copernica is mostly recognized for the comprehensive
email-toolkit which is designed especially for marketeers and 
webshops. Inside Copernica you find both the new Marketing Suite
and the older Publisher. These services both serve the same goal,
but are used quite differently. Marketing Suite is the newer software 
and is the most user-friendly. Therefore it is strongly recommended 
to start with the Marketing Suite if you are new to Copernica software.

While reading the Copernica documentation, it's best practice to 
have access to the software. To login, you'll need a username 
and password to do so. You'll receive these credentials
automatically once you create a profile via www.copernica.com.
From this central point you can navigate to all Copernica
services seamlessly. If you are already a customer you have probably seen 
the toggle in the Marketing Suite, which allows you to switch to the 
Publisher environment. If you're still transitioning to Marketing Suite 
from Publisher this will make it easier for you.
