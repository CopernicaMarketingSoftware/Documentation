# Introduction

Copernica develops multiple email-related products like 
[MailerQ](www.mailerq.com) and [SMTPeter](www.smtpeter.com).
However, Copernica is mostly recognized for the comprehensive
email-toolkit which is designed especially for marketeers and 
webshops. Inside Copernica you find both the new Marketing Suite
and the older Publisher. These services both serve the same goal,
but are used quite differently. The Marketing Suite is in fact
a lot easier to use and consequently advised to our new customers.

While reading the Copernica documentation, it's best practice to 
have access to the software. To login, you'll need a username 
and password to do so. You'll receive these credentials
automatically once you create a profile via www.copernica.com.
From this central point you can navigate to all Copernica
services accordingly. As existing customer, you most-likely 
have seen the toggle, which lets you switch between the 
Marketing Suite and the Publisher. This makes it easier 
to start using the Marketing Suite (if you still use the
older Publisher).
