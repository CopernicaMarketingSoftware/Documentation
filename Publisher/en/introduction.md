# Introduction

As you may know, Copernica develops multiple e-mail related products, 
such as [MailerQ](www.mailerq.com) and [SMTPeter](www.smtpeter.com). 
However, we are mostly known for our complete online marketing automation toolkits, 
the old Publisher and the brand new Marketing Suite. 
For many our company name "Copernica" has even become synonymous to the 
products we offer.

The documentation you're about to read concerns the Copernica Marketing 
Software, Publisher and Marketing Suite, our main products. The websites of 
MailerQ and SMTPeter contain their own documentation, which you should refer 
to when necessary. In some documentation we might refer to the software 
as "Copernica", in this case we almost always refer to the old Publisher 
environment.

Whilst reading this documentation, it is useful to have access to the 
software itself. To gain access, you need a username and a password, 
which you'll automatically receive when you sign up at [www.copernica.com](https://www.copernica.com). 
Using these credentials, you can log into the Marketing Suite, in which 
you can also switch to Publisher. Using our documentation you can now 
start setting up marketing campaigns immediately.

## Multiple places to log in

With your Copernica credentials, it is easiest to log in via 
[www.copernica.com](https://www.copernica.com), because it's a central 
hub from where you can access all Copernica accounts and applications. 
You can also login directly to the “new” Marketing Suite via [ms.copernica.com](https://ms.copernica.com).

Once logged in, you'll find a big rectangle button which lets you toggle 
between the MarketingSuite and the Publisher. This button can be found 
in the left hand side menu, situated at the top.

## The difference between 'Copernica Marketing Suite' and 'Copernica Publisher'

Copernica has been offering software solutions for over a decade, during 
which we've created multiple tools. Among these are on-premise MailerQ, 
cloud-based SMTPeter and online marketing tools Publisher and Marketing 
Suite.

Marketing Suite and Publisher largely intersect in their features: 
Both tools are meant for creating complete online marketing campaigns, 
which is why a Copernica license gives you access to both. Publisher is 
the 'old' environment, being over 10 years old. It lets users create 
campaigns in a fairly technical and detailed way. MarketingSuite, on 
the other hand, is new and easier to use. Under the hood, the two are 
equal: data inserted in one system, can be used by the other.

Because Marketing Suite is still under construction, not all of 
Publisher's features are available in Marketing Suite yet. To use 
Copernica to its full potential, it may be needed at times to switch 
between Publisher and Marketing Suite. Along the way, more and more of 
Publisher's features are being added to MarketingSuite, so in the future 
you won't have to switch anymore. The documentation describes both 
Marketing Suite and Publisher and distinguishes between them where 
necessary.
