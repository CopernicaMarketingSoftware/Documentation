# Introduction

Copernica has a very comprehensive email tool kit for marketers and developers. In addition to other email-related products such as [SMTPeter](https://www.smtpeter.com) and [MailerQ](https://www.mailerq.com), our Marketing Software also consists of two different products, the Marketing Suite and the Publisher. The Marketing Suite enables you to quickly and easily develop and send personalized templates with conditional content. If you need more flexibility in developing email templates, for example, by dynamically building your templates with atom/rss feeds, you can use the Publisher. You can also create web forms and sms messages within the Publisher's environment.

Via the Copernica dashboard, accessible through [copernica.com](https://www.copernica.com), you can control all users and account cases. You can also simply navigate to the Marketing Suite or Publisher.
