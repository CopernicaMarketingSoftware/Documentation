# Using video and GIFs in emails

Video is very useful in marketing: It's fun, it's engaging and can be 
used to convey powerful messages. Unfortunately many email clients do 
not support video in an email, but there are ways to get around that. 
In this article we will discuss some methods to use GIFs and videos to 
make your email more interesting

## Link to your video

If you have a video on youtube, your website or hosted elsewhere you can 
simply link to it from your email. We suggest using a nice image from 
the video with a play icon on it to invite your users to click the link 
to your video. Be sure to add `?play` to the end of your video link to 
start playing the video immediately when the user clicks the link.

## GIFs

GIFs can be used to add a short animation to your email without worrying 
about external hosting. You can use to display different colors or styles 
of your product, for example. GIFs are an older format, so email clients 
have had some time to adapt. They are supported in every client except 
Outlook and Windows Phone 7. Outlook and Windows Phone 7 will only show 
the first frame of your GIF, so you can still use them, but keep in mind 
that this is the only information the users of these clients will receive.

## Animated link to your video

It is also very interesting to combine the GIF and the image with the 
play button. GIFs may also contain a link and can be used to give a 
preview for the video you are linking to. The GIF engages the user and 
the link allows the user to explore your company further.
