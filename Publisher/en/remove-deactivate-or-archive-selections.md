Selections that you hardly use can be archived, deleted or disabled.
This way you maintain a little overview, plus you improve the
performance of the remaining selections.

### Removing selection

When a selection is no longer in use, you can remove it. The fewer
selections in a database, the faster the remaining selections become.
Take a little consideration if you still need a selection. Don't need
it? To the trash with it!

To remove the selection, go to the *Edit selections...* dialog and click
the selection you want to delete, and then click the delete button to
remove the selection permanently.

Removing selections has no influence on the profiles in your database.
These obviously remain unaffected. To remove or edit all profiles from a
selection, another function already exists.

### Disable selection conditions

If you cannot say goodbye to a selection, you can consider disabling its
conditions.

A condition that has been disabled will not be rebuilt until you
reactive it. You activate the condition just when you need it.

You will find the option to disable the condition when editing the
condition.

### Archive selections

Selections can also be archived. So you can keep overview. Note:
Archived selections remain active and are therefore still frequently
updated. Archiving selections therefore has no influence on the
performance of your other selections. Better discart them if you don't
use them at all.

To archive the selection first click the selection in the left overview.
Then select **Archive** from the Current View menu.
