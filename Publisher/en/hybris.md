A generic version of a Hybris plugin is currently not available.

Are you using Hybris as ecommerce platform? In that case you'll be able
to connect this platform to Copernica with the Hybris integration.
Synchronise data from Hybris with Copernica by using Copernica's SOAP
API. This way you'll keep all your client details up to date and be able
to send targeted email campaigns.

About Hybris
------------

The integration will, for example, enable you to set up the following
marketing campaigns:

-   Abandoned shopping carts: Send clients an emailing to remind them of
    a purchase that they never finished.
-   Loyalty programs: Email your loyal customers a personalized discount
    voucher that they can use in your store.
-   Win back campaigns: Re-activate clients that haven't been in your
    webshop for more than 6 months by sending them a personal offer.
