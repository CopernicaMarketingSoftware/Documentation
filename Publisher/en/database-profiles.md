A profile is a single record in a database. With the Copernica REST API
you can retrieve profile information, create new profiles and update
existing profiles with new information. With the field-parameter it is
also possible to search for profiles through the database. This method
gives you access to all profiles associated with a given database.

| Request url | Methods | Parameters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| https://api.copernica.com/database/\$databaseID/profiles | GET, POST, DELETE | fields[], start, limit |

GET request
-----------

The URL will retrieve all profiles from \$databaseID. Include the
**limit** and/or **start**
[parameters](./rest-api-parameters.md)
in your request to specify the number and range of profiles returned.

The profile **secret** is used to identify a user in web forms and to
auto login a user that clicks from an email to a Copernica-hosted
webpage. The hash value is auto generated by Copernica.

If any, you will also receive an array with the [interests of the
profile](./profile-interests.md), and the date on which the profile was
created.

### Searching for profiles with the GET request

By providing an array of fields and search criteria in the GET request
of *\$DatabaseID/profiles*, it is possible to search for profiles in
your database. For example, if you want to search all profiles from your
database with id=8, with 'Hank' as firstname (field Firstname="Hank")
and which are not subscribed for the newsletter (field
Newsletter!="Yes"), the request would look something like this:

~~~~ {.language-javascript}
database/8/profiles?fields[]=Firstname%3D%3DHank&fields[]=Newsletter%21%3DYes&access_token=...
~~~~

POST request
------------

A POST request can be used to create a profile. There is no need to
include the profile identifier in the message, since the URL contains
it.

### Example message

~~~~ {.language-javascript}
{
    "Company" : "Copernica",
    "Visit_Address" : "Copernicaplein 112",
    "Email" : "info@copernica.com",
    ...
}
~~~~

PUT request
-----------

Use the PUT request to update profiles in the database associated with
databaseID. The PUT request is always in conjunction with the required
`fields[]` parameter.

DELETE request
--------------

A profile can be deleted with the DELETE request. This will remove the
profile with identifier \$profileID from the database. No additional
information is needed to delete a profile, as the profile identifier is
already present in the URL.
