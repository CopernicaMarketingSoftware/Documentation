# Databases and profiles
Copernica does not use adress lists, but instead
works with fully configurable databases which you can structure
to your own liking. In your databases, you will keep track of all customers
you want to send emails to. In the context of a database, we refer to these
customers as *profiles*.

Copernica stores a lof of data about the behaviour of your profiles,
such as clicks, opens, bounces and errors. In other marketing software,
people often keep their mailing lists separate, but this would make our
behaviour tracking ineffective. We therefore advise you to always update your
existing databases, instead of periodically creating new ones.

## Multidimensional databases
Copernica databases can be layered, allowing you to - for example - store
purchase histories. It is also possible to make [selections](./selections-
introduction) which can be used for the segmentation and personalization of
your email campaigns.

There are almost no restrictions on how you can structure your database.
You could create a simple structure which only tracks a profile's first name,
last name, and email adress or a complex structure in which you keep track of
every item a customer has purchased in the past. We advise you to keep the
structure simple if you are just starting out as to not be overwhelmed. You
always have the option to track more information at a later time.

### Creating a new database in the Marketing Suite
In the Marketing Suite, you can create a new database in the section
**Database & Profiles**. To do so, click on the plus sign in the top-left
corner. Here you can select the option to create a new database and give it
a name. The next step is to add the structure to your database by adding
fields and selections.

**Note**: There is no difference between databases created in the Marketing
Suite and those created in the Publisher. A change made in the Publisher
will therefore also affect the Marketing Suite.

### Creating a new database in the Publisher
In the Publisher, you can create a new database in the **Profiles** section.
Here you must select the option **Create a new database...** the dropdown
menu **Database management** at the top of the screen. You will then be
able to give the new database a name. Once you have confirmed the creation,
the database will appear on the left-hand side of the screen.
The next step is to add the structure to your database by adding
fields and selections.

**Note**: There is no difference between databases created in the Marketing
Suite and those created in the Publisher. A change made in the Publisher
will therefore also affect the Marketing Suite.

## Profiles
A profile is the description of a person or company in your database. You are
free to determine what information you would like to keep track of about a
profile by adding fields to a database. As we mentioned earlier in this
article, Copernica automaticaly keeps track of the behaviour of a profile.
For example what emails they open, what links they click on, and if emails
have been recieved.

### Creatting profiles in the Marketing Suite
In the Marketing Suite you can create a new profile in a database by selecting
the database and then clicking on person icon above the database view.
If you want to add multiple profiles at once, it is better to
[import](./database-import) them instead.

### Creating profiles in Publisher
In the Publisher you can create a new profile in the **Profiles** section by
selecting the database you want to add the profile to. Then you select
the option **create profile...** from the **Profile** dropdown menu at the
top of the screen. If you want to add multiple profiles at once, it is better
to [import](./database-import) them instead.
