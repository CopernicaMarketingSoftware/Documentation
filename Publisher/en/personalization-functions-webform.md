# Personalization functions: webform

The *webform* function can be used to include a webform in your document 
if you have already created a webform and supply a valid [XSLT](./css-and-xslt).

## Example

    {webform name="mywebform" xslt="mystyle"}
    
By including this line you include the webform with the given name in the 
style of the given XSLT.
