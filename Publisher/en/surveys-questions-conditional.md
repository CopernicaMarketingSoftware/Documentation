# Surveys: Conditional questions

Conditional questions are used when you want to use a different set of 
questions based on the answer to a question. An example:

**Q1. What is your age?**
 If age is \> 18, skip survey and go to thank you page
 Otherwise, proceed with Q2.
**Q2. How is it to be born after 1994?**

This can be done with advanced JavaScript and XLST programming skills, but 
is not (yet) a standard functionality in the survey module.
