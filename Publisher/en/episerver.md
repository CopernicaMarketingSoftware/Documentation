Using the EPiServer integration you will be able to automatically
synchronize all user data from EPiServer with your client profiles
within Copernica Marketing Software. With the help of the integration
you can easily set up targeted marketing campaigns with Copernica based
on the data you extract from EPiServer CMS. We currently have two
different EpiServer integrations, the EpiServer CMS6 integration and the
EpiServer CMS7 + Commerce integration.

About EPiServer CMS6
--------------------

The integration with EPiServer CMS6 is facilitated within the
Administration mode, enabling a one-time or sychronizing link with
Copernica. Using this link, the fields from EPiServer can easily be
extended and linked to the profile database in Copernica.

EPiServer is mainly used by high-end websites because of its powerful
community functionality and personalization options.
