## Managing CSS stylesheet files

The CSS style sheets that you use within your campaigns, are managed in
the Style section. Select the CSS stylesheet and then choose the desired
action from the Stylesheet context menu.

New stylesheet
--------------

The Style component allows you to create new stylesheets with the
Stylesheet menu.

The stylesheet is generic and contains tabs to create stylesheets for
general, RSS, Atom, surveys and web forms. **All in one file**.

Each stylesheet is composed with example coding which you can use to
base your own stylesheet on.

Rename stylesheet
-----------------

An existing stylesheet can be renamed. To change the name of a
stylesheet, find the so-called function in the Stylesheet menu.

Remove stylesheet
-----------------

A stylesheet which is removed from Style is irretrievable. Publications
of it will no longer function.

You may remove the file through the stylesheet menu, but you may wish to
archive instead to preserve a copy of the file.

Import stylesheet
-----------------

A stylesheet created outside the application can be imported through the
Stylesheet menu.

First create an empty stylesheet and select it, then choose this
function. The import file should be a .*css* or .*zip* . Define for
which type of content the file is meant from the Style type list.

Export stylesheet
-----------------

Stylesheets can be exported from the application through the stylesheet
menu. This will allow you to download a ZIP file with .css files for
each tab of the stylesheet (general, rss etc.).
