Personalise your emails
-----------------------

![Personalize your

Improve your results by personalising your emails. Copernica offers you
the option to fully personalise your mailings with all the stored
contact data in your Copernica
[database](./creating-your-own-databases.md "Creating your own database").
You can personalise using details such as someone’s last name and also
using historical data, campaign results, survey results and much more.

-   Add personal details, such as a name, an address or purchased
    products
-   Adjust the content or design of your email based on interests and
    preferences
-   Personalise a subject line or add a link to a [web
    form](./various-types-of-web-forms.md "Create online web forms") 

For the personalising of your emails and other marketing campaigns,
Copernica also works with Smarty tags or Smarty code. This is a template
engine for PHP.

### How does personalisation with Smarty work?

Once you start working with personalisation codes, you’ll notice just
how easy it is. You decide what details you want to use in an email.
Copernica will replace the fields using Smarty tags with personal
details before you [send the
email](./send-emailings-to-relations.md "Send emailings to relations").
You can use any data you store in your
[database](./creating-your-own-databases.md "Creating your own database")
to personalise emailings.

An example of how it works:

Example code

Will show as:

Dear {\$Salutation}{\$Firstname}{\$Lastname},\
Thank you for your application.\
 Kind regards,\
 {\$Accountmanager}

Dear Mr. Douglas Adams,\
 Thank you for your application.\
Kind regards,\
 Arthur Dent

Dynamic content in your emailings
---------------------------------

![Dynamic content in your

Would you like to keep your contacts informed about your latest products
or your breaking news, for example from your website? Copernica has the
solution in the form of content feeds, or [RSS or Atom
feeds](http://www.copernica.com/en/features/web-pages/rss-or-atom-feed "RSS or Atom feed").
Easily create your own feeds in Copernica and use them in emailings to
keep the contents up to date - automatically.

### Add your own styling to a content feed

In Copernica you have the option to easily add your own styling to your
content feeds and also decide how many, and in what order, feed articles
should be included in your emailing. You could include the last three
purchased items, for example.

To do this, use a CSS style sheet or XSLT style document. Create these
documents in Copernica, or upload existing style documents. With your
own styling you can make your newsletters even more personal and add
some exciting dynamics to the whole email.

Composing emailings with SOAP API
---------------------------------

Copernica has a powerful [SOAP
API](./soap-api-documentation.md "Copernica SOAP API"),
that enables you to connect your external software package and
Copernica. With the SOAP API it’s also possible to create email
documents, load external content and send your emails.
