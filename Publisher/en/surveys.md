# Surveys

Customers have an opinion. About politics, and Justin Bieber's haircut.
Or about your product or service. Use the Copernica survey module to
make these opinions quantifiable. This will help you improve your product
or service.

The results of your survey can be viewed in Copernica and downloaded to
an Excel file. You can also lookup the answers given by a specific
respondent in your Copernica database. For tips on good data gathering 
please see our article on
