It is possible to make your website in Copernica available through a
secure https connection. If you use a subdomain under Copernica.com (eg.
mycompany.copernica.com) then no additional actions are required from
you. If you have your website however linked to a subdomain under your
own domain (mycompany.com), then you need to request a SSL certificate
first and deliver it to us.

For example you need a https connection if you want to associate your
Copernica site with Facebook. Making your website available through
https is done in a few steps (in chronological order).

The steps:

-   If you do not have a certificate yet, then you need to [apply for
    one](https://www.google.com/#hl=en&gs_rn=7&gs_ri=psy-ab&tok=_IWNtiiaK2OLQfql5IgsQQ&cp=11&gs_id=1k&xhr=t&q=request+ssl+certificate&es_nrs=true&pf=p&output=search&sclient=psy-ab&oq=request+ssl&gs_l=&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&bvm=bv.44158598,d.ZWU&fp=3250b750bf5d41db&biw=1280&bih=899)
    first. All types of SSL-certificates will work.
-   If you do not have a dedicated IP address at Copernica yet, then you
    should request one. We charge a small fee monthly for this address.
    You can contact our support department for this request.
-   Once you have received the certificate from them, hand it to our
    support department (contact via support@copernica.com). They need
    the SSL-certificate, it's private key, the intermediate-certificate
    and the root-certificate. Never send this information unencrypted.
-   Once all steps are completed, you can set your website in Copernica
    to be offered via a secure connection offer. You can find this
    option via the Website menu \> **Settings ...**

You can optionally use Skype to send the certificate encrypted or upload
it yourself to a secure FTP server from where we can download it. Ask
our support staff about the possibilities.
