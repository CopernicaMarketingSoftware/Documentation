Return Path is a service that helps you optimize the deliverability of
your emails. It does so by monitoring your sent emails and by making
arrangements between receiving parties (Internet Service Providers,
ISPs) and sending parties (Email Service Providers, ESPs and marketers).

![](../images/returnpath-logo.png)Copernica is a certified Return
Path partner, meaning that as a Copernica user, you have a head start
when applying for a certificate. Copernica ensures that your email
messages are delivered correctly to ISPs, that you have clear insight in
your spam score and that your IP address has a good email reputation.

dedicated IP address).

Apply for certificate
---------------------

Return Path uses a [request form](../downloads/application-form-returnpath.pdf)
to check if sending parties are eligible for a certificate. It checks
your dedicated IP address (has to be in use for at least 90 days) and
the sending domains you use.
