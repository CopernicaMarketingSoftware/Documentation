# REST API: deleting a rule

When you send an HTTP DELETE request to the following URL, youâ€™ll delete 
a rule:

`https://api.copernica.com/v1/rule/$id?access_token=xxxx`

The $id needs to be replaced by the numerical identifier of the rule
that you want to remove.

## PHP example

The following example demonstrates how to make a call using this method.

	// dependencies
	require_once('copernica_rest_api.php');

	// change this into your access token
	$api = new CopernicaRestApi("your-access-token");

	// do the call
	$api->delete("rule/1234");

This example uses the [CopernicaRestAPi class](rest-php).
