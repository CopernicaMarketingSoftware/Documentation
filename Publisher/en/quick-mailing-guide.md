# Your first mailings

Let's create your first email! It is recommended you start with the 
Marketing Suite's user-friendly drag 'n drop editor, as it is much easier 
to start with than Publisher's editor. You don't need to do any coding in 
Marketing Suite's editor. This article describes how to create an email in 
both programs.

If you want to try some more advanced topics you can inspect the articles 
under "More information".

## Creating a template

In the Marketing Suite, you simply drag and drop content blocks onto your 
template such as text, headers, images, social media buttons, and much more. 
Hit send after you've finished and the rest speaks for itself.
You can find the 'email templates' tab in the menu, where it's also possible to 
create a template by clicking on the green button on the top right.
If you want to quickly put together a beautiful and professional looking email, 
the Marketing Suite is the way to go.

## Send the mailing

To send the mailing you select your template. You then enter things such 
as the sender domain you want to use and the subject of the email. You 
can schedule it for a later time or send it immediately. You can add tags 
to organize and categorize for own use. The target for your mail can be 
a [database](./database-introduction) or a [selection](./selections-introduction). 
Mails can also be sent automatically through [followups](./follow-up-manager).
