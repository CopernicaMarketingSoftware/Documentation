# Your first drag-'n-drop mailings

Copernica has two totally different ways of creating mailings. The old way in Publisher involves
creating your own HTML templates, whereas in MarketingSuite you drag and drop your email
together with pre-coded elements.

Putting together mailings is a lot easier in MarketingSuite than in Publisher. However, many
people still use Publisher due to its extended options. Publisher requires you to code your own
HTML and CSS, but it gives you the freedom to make whatever you want, whereas in
MarketingSuite you're limited to what the drag-'n-drop editor offers you. For now, Publisher also
has some more options for follow-up actions.

MarketingSuite, on the other hand, needs little to no explanation. Simply drag and drop content
blocks onto your template such as text, headers, images, social media buttons, and much more. Hit
send after you've finished and the rest speaks for itself.
The choice is yours: if you prefer user friendliness and want to quickly put together a beautiful and
professional looking email, use the MarketingSuite. If you're a little more computer-savvy and
want full freedom in your creations, use Publisher.
