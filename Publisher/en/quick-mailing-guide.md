# Your first drag-'n-drop mailings

In the Marketing Suite, you simply drag and drop content blocks onto your 
template such as text, headers, images, social media buttons, and much more. 
Hit send after you've finished and the rest speaks for itself.
If you want to quickly put together a beautiful and professional looking email, 
the Marketing Suite is the way to go.
