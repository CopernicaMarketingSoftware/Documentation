# Personalization functions: rawcapture

Rawcapture works extremely similar to [capture](./personalization-functions-capture), 
but does not use HTML escaping. This is useful if you want to capture a 
block of HTML to use later in your code. Please see the article on 
[capture](./personalization-functions-capture) for examples. It is also 
somewhat similar to [assign](./personalization-functions-assign).
