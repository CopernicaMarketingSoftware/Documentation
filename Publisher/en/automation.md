# Marketing automation

Automation is happening everywhere: Copernica's [sender domains](./quick-sender-domain-guide), 
for example, make sure your emails are authenticated automatically. 
However, Copernica also offers several functionalities to automate your own 
campaigns and make your job easier!

With Copernica you can send emails automatically, or personalize emails by 
using data about your customers. The personal greeting is a well known 
classic within marketing, but did you know that you can also tailor the 
content of your email to the interests of your customers?

In this article we will explain the many possibilities of 
[selections](./selections-introduction), [personalization](./personalization) 
and [follow-ups](./followups). With selections you can group customers 
and with personalization you can tailor emails specifically for each customer. 
Follow-ups can be used to automatically perform actions based on triggers 
like clicks, unsubscribes and profile modifications.

## Sending email

Copernica has a powerful database system in which you can easily group 
customers into [selections](./selections-introduction). You can use 
these to make a newsletter selection, for example, allowing you to 
only email those who have subscribed to your newsletter. Or you can create 
a birthday selection, so you can congratulate each customer on their birthday 
without the hassle of sending those emails by hand.

You can also send emails as the reaction to a trigger. You can achieve 
this and much more with Copernica's [follow-ups](./followups).

## Personalizing email

[Personalizing email](./personalization) can be done by plugging customer 
information into the template directly, but you can also use this information 
to specify conditions. Using this method you can choose which content blocks 
to use in your email, for example. Copernica uses the template engine 
[Smarty](https://www.smarty.net/), but we also offer a range of our own 
useful functions and modifiers.

## Automating databases

With [follow-ups](./followups) it's also possible to edit (sub)profiles 
based on triggers like link clicks and unsubscribes. You can write your 
own unsubscribe behaviour using this functionality, for example.
