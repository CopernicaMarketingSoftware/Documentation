# Unsubscribe behaviour

Copernica receives all sorts of feedback from users who want to unsubscribe
from mailing lists. These triggers come in different ways. Usually they come
in the form of unsubscribe links in mailings and feedback from a user
clicking the unsubscribe button in their email client. However, we can
also receive complaints at our abuse address or be informed when a user
marks your mail as spam. Copernica collects and handles these triggers
according to your preferred unsubscribe behaviour. This behaviour must be
set for every database you use.

You as a customer must decide what the response should be to an unsubscribe
that Copernica receives. There are several options: ignoring the trigger,
deleting the entire profile or changing a field value. Ignoring the trigger
is illegal and may result in many unstatisfied customers. If you change a
field value you can use it to make a
[newsletter selection](./create-a-mailing-list).

## Marketing Suite settings
Unsubscribe behaviour can be set for each database individually. In the
**Database & Profiles** section, select your database and click on the
cog wheel in the bar on the top of your screen. You can now set your
unsubscribe behaviour.

## Publisher settings
First go to the **Profiles** section and select the database you want
to change the behaviour of. You can then find the unsubscribe options under
**Database management** and determine how you want to handle unsubscriptions.

## More information
Now you know who your most valuable profiles are: those who want to receive
your email. If you keep profile data from unsubscriptions, you should make a
newsletter selection to exclude them from your mailings. Find out more
