# Setting unsubscribe options

Copernica receives all sorts of feedback from users who want to unsubscribe 
from mailing lists. Itâ€™s up to you how you react to unsubscribe triggers: 
ignore them (which is illegal and might make those receiving email quite angry), 
delete the entire profile or change a field value. If you change a field 
value you can use it to make a selection of only those who want to receive 
the newsletter, but you still keep profile data.

Triggers come in different ways. Usually they come in the form of 
unsubscribe links in mailings and feedback from a user clicking the 
unsubscribe button in their email client. The latter is shown in some 
clients if a list-unsubscribe header is present in the email.

However, there are other triggers besides those two. For example, when 
we receive a complaint at our abuse address. Some email providers have 
feedback loops that give us a heads up when someone logs an email as spam. 
These types of feedback are caught by Copernica and processed according 
to your unsubscribe options.

## Marketing Suite settings

Unsubscribe behaviour can be set for each database individually. In the 
'Database & Profiles' section, select your database and click on the 
cog wheel in the bar on the top of your screen. You can now set your 
unsubscribe behaviour.

## Publisher settings

First go to the **Profiles** component and select the database you want 
to change the behaviour of. You can then find the unsubscribe options under 
**Database management** and determine how you want to handle unsubscribes.
