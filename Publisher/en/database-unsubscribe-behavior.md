# Unsubscribe behaviour

Copernica receives all sorts of feedback from users who want to unsubscribe 
from mailing lists. Itâ€™s up to you how you react to unsubscribe triggers: 
ignore them (which is illegal and might make those receiving email quite angry), 
delete the entire profile or change a field value. If you change a field 
value you can use it to make a [newsletter selection](./create-a-mailing-list).

Triggers come in different ways. Usually they come in the form of 
unsubscribe links in mailings and feedback from a user clicking the 
unsubscribe button in their email client. However, we can also receive 
complaints at our abuse address or be informed when a user marks your mail 
as spam. Copernica collects and handles these triggers according to your 
preferred unsubscribe behaviour.

## Marketing Suite settings

Unsubscribe behaviour can be set for each database individually. In the 
'Database & Profiles' section, select your database and click on the 
cog wheel in the bar on the top of your screen. You can now set your 
unsubscribe behaviour.

## Publisher settings

First go to the **Profiles** component and select the database you want 
to change the behaviour of. You can then find the unsubscribe options under 
**Database management** and determine how you want to handle unsubscribes.
