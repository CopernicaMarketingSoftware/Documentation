# Split run mailing setup

Split run testing enables you to create different versions of a document
for one mass mailing. The different versions are sent to small groups of
contacts, to test the effectiveness of each version. Based on the
results of the test mailings, the system will send the most effective
document to all remaining contacts.

**Conduct a split run to test**

-   How different subject lines score
-   Two completely or slightly different lay-outs. For instance the new
    versus the old template lay-out
-   A different tone of voice or approach
-   A personalized mail versus a non-personalized email
-   To see if your subscribers prefer blue over red call-to-action
    buttons
-   …

The winning document can be determined by the number of clicks,
impressions or errors. You may also write a custom condition to find a
winner.

## 1. Initializing your split run test

Create the documents you’d like to include in the test. There is no
limit set on the number of documents that can be included, but 3
documents seems the most scientifically justified number (two test
versions, and a neutral version). The documents may be created with
different templates. \
\
 Give the documents distinctive names, such as Document A, Document B,
and Document C. 

**Note:** Make sure that each document has the required header
information (sender address, subject line).

## 2. Setting up the split run mailing

Sending a split run mailing does not differ from sending a regular mass
mailing. It however has an extra step.

 \

Select one of the documents from the mailing, go to the mass mailing
dialog. Choose the target selection or miniselection, and check the
option Split-run in the lower right corner of the dialog screen. A new
tab will appear. Open this tab to see the split run options.

## 3. Adding the documents

Documents are managed in the upper part of the Documents tab. To add a
document, click 'Add document'. In the screen that appears next, you can
select any document from the application. \
\
 There is no upper limit to the number of documents that can be added.

## 4. Document: Choose a document

**Group size:** the extent of recipients for this document. This can be
set in percentage or absolute numbers. The recipients are randomly
picked. \
\
**Interval:** Use the interval setting to indicate when the document
should be sent to the test group, counting backwards to the sending of
the winning document. \
\
 If you set a document with an interval of 1 hour, the document will be
sent to the test group 1 hour in advance to the final mailing.

interval](../images/setup-splitrun-mailing2.png)

Please note: If a mailing with split run is scheduled to send at a later
time, the application will calculate regressively from the set timestamp
to determine when the split run should be conducted. \
\
 The interval and group options must be set separately for all documents
included in the split run mailing.

## 5. Sending the split run mailing

Click the Next button to send the split run mailing. If you find this
button deactivated, you may have forgotten to set something. Have you
defined the target selection? Does this target have the proper
intentions? Does the target database have a field designated a an email
field? \
\
*Double check the settings in the final overview. Hit the send button to
send the mailing.*

## Split run has been sent. Curious about the results?

To see the results of the split run mailing, go to *Mailings \>
Statistics*. Locate the mailing in the list, select it and view its
results by clicking *Show full statistics* report. You can find more 
information about statistics in [this article](./statistics)\
\
 You will find information about the performance of each test group,
plus the results of the winning document (final mailing).
