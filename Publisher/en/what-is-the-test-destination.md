The application allows every user to set his or her own test
destination. The test destination is the (sub)profile that is used when
sending test mailings and test text messages. Furthermore, it allows you
to see what personalization is added using the 'Preview Mode'. This
gives you a good idea of what your mailing will look like once
personalized with (your) data.

**Note:** it does concern ONE test destination per user. Each user has
to set this destination separately. Multiple users can set the same test
destination. However, one user can not have more than one test
destination. You can change your test destination at any time.Â 

### Setting the test destination

Setting the test destination can be done from two locations within the
application.

-   Under **Profiles**: First select the (sub)profile you want as your
    test destination in the database. Next, click on 'set test
    destination...' (in the Profile-menu). Select the correct
    destination from the possible destinations provided. Then click
    'store'.
-   From your personal menu (Welcome *your name*): Open your personal
    menu at the top right of the application. Click on 'Choose test
    destination...', from here you can also change your test
    destination.

**What is my current test destination?**

To see what profile or subprofile is currently set as your test
destination, go to your personal menu at the top right corner of the
application, then click **Choose test destination**.
