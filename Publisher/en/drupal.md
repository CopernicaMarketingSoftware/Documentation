Copernica User
--------------

A Drupal site requires a standard registration from its user. This
module creates the possibility to collect user information when a Drupal
user is created, when he or she logs in or makes an update. Used in
combination with the Copernica Drupal Commerce module, this opens a
window of opportunities for location based communication or offers based
on interest for example.

Copernica Drupal Commerce
-------------------------

Copernica Queue
---------------

A module that can be used to store items ready to be sent to Copernica.
This module will do nothing by itself and is used by other modules such
as Copernica Entity so any data to be sent to Copernica can be sent from
a background request rather than slowing the user’s experience of the
site.

Copernica Entity
----------------

A framework style module that allows sending any Drupal entity to
Copernica. It can send data based on an entity being created or updated
as well as remove data when the entity is deleted from the web site.
Properties / fields from the Drupal entities can be mapped to Copernica
fields and with a little bit of PHP, custom properties and altered
values can be sent too. This module requires the Copernica Queue module
above.
