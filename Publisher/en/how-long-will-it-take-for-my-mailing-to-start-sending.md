The mailing will basically start immediately after you have pushed the
send button.This process is irreversible, once you have pressed the send
button, the mailing will be fully delivered.

Scheduled mailings
------------------

Before a scheduled mailing is sent, the target selection is first
updated. This may take several minutes to complete,

-   depending on the type of the selection,
-   the size of the database
-   and the load on our servers.

Once the selection is updated, the mailing will be sent immediately. If
a mailing still has no signs of life after half an hour or so, please
contact our support department.

How long will it take for my mailing to be delivered to all recipients?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Also this again depends on the size of your mailinglist. We can only
have a maximum number of messages per minute delivered to recipient mail
servers. We offer more emails, then they could start complaining, or
even block your messages.

There are also emails that can not be directly delivered due to
(temporary) errors at the receiving end. Because we do over 20 delivery
attempts, spread over 48 hours, it can happen that someone recieves the
email one or two days later. If you do not want this, (because you're
sending daily discounts for instance), you can lower the number of
delivery attempts yourself (via *Admin\> Account\>***Delivery
settings**).
