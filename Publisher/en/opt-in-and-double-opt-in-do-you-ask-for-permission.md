Getting started with [email
marketing](./emailings.md "Email marketing")?
Then be sure to use an opt-in. It is important for your relation to
grant 'unequivocal' permission for further processing their personal
data. The relation clearly indicates that the personal data can be
processed and used for a specific reason. For example, for sending a
newsletter.

Granting permission to send emails or text messages is done by
submitting the email address or mobile phone number on a website. Or by
sending a 'subscribe'-mail to a specific subscription-address.

Double opt-in
-------------

Use a double opt-in system to confirm the permission of the relation.
This can prevent spam complaints. Double opt-in or confirmed opt-in
means the permission granted by the relation is verified. The
verification consists of sending an email to the given email address
asking the recipient for confirmation of his subscription. The relation
can then verify by replying by email or by clicking on a confirmation
hyperlink.

Soft opt-in
-----------

You do not need to ask for permission when existing clients are
contacted concerning similar products or services. This concerns a soft
opt-in. Soft opt-in can be used when email marketing is used:

-   Within a proper group of companies
-   Towards an existing customer relation
-   When selling an own product or service
-   When the provided information falls within the expectations of the
    recipient

When the provided information falls within the expectations of the
recipient We recommend always using an
[opt-out](./opt-out-do-not-stop-your-client.md "Opt-out").
The customer has to be able to unsubscribe at all times.
