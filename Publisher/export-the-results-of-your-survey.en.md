The results of a survey can be downloaded through the **Survey**menu.

-   Downloading **survey results** will generate a file displaying how
    many times each answer was given and all open answers.
-   Downloading **submitted surveys** will generate a file displaying
    the answers given by each participant, if that participant is
    registered it will include profile data.

Exports can be generated as XML files or [tab delimited](#). The latter
of which is the custom format for Excel.
