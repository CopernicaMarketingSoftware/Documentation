A database is a collection of contacts. For example all companies or
newsletter subscribers that you wish to target with marketing actions.

1. Create a database
--------------------

To create a new database, choose the so named function in Profiles under
'Database management'. Give the database a distinguishable name and
description without special characters.

2. Create the fields
--------------------

Once you have created your database, you can start adding fields to the
database.

In a database you store information in fields. For example a field with
email addresses, one for the family name and one for a phone number.

To add and edit fields, choose the function Edit database fields in
Profiles under ‘Database management’.

Depending on the type of data you’d like to store in a database field,
you can choose different field types. To store email addresses, you can
use the email field, for numeric values (such as age) you may choose a
numeric field, and so forth.

Should I index my fields?
-------------------------

You can choose to index a database or collection field. Indexing a field
can speed up the performance of selections and miniselections that are
based on this field. However it is not recommended to index fields that
are less needed / searched. Having too many indexed fields could have a
negative impact on performance.

-   You can index up to 64 fields per database and collection.
-   A ‘big field’ cannot be indexed.
-   You can index a field by selecting the checkbox in the Edit field
    dialog.

What is a collection and how can I add one?
-------------------------------------------

A collection is a subset of data linked to a database. When you wish to
add several items of similar data to your profiles, use a collection.
For example multiple contact persons within the profile of an
organisation.

Each data compiled within a collection is called a subprofile, because
it is subject to a profile. So in our example, each contact person's
data is one subprofile.

### Create a collection

You can add a collection to a database from the ‘Edit fields’ dialog.
Here you will find the option Add collection. There is no limit set to
the number of collections you can add.

### Segment subprofile with mini selections

Selections created on collections are called mini selections. They can
be added in the Edit selections dialog.

### Collection fields

A collection field functions the same as a database field, except that
information stored here is placed at a 'sublevel'. It creates
subprofiles which are part of a profile. New collection fields can be
added the same way as database fields: use 'add field' and then choose
the 'Collection ' from the Source list.

### Mailing subprofiles

Data from subprofiles can be used to send mailings. If you mark the
Content of a field as containing e-mail/mobile/fax, it will be
available. This can be used for example to send birthday greetings to
individual contact persons within a collection.
