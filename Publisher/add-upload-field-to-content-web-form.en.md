The web form upload field allows visitors of your website to upload a
file to their own profiles.

With upload files you could think of

-   an application letter
-   a profile picture (avatar)
-   a duck

To include an upload field in your web form, go to your web form. Click
'**add field**' and choose '**Upload field**'. This will bring you at
the settings for the upload field.

Files uploaded through the webform are automatically stored at the
profile that uploaded the file.

Also read: [Manage files uploaded to profiles in your
database](./manage-files-uploaded-to-profiles-in-your-database)\
