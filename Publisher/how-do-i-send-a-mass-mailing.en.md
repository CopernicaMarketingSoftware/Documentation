E-mailing multiple contacts at once is called mass mailing. The Send
mass mailing function in the 'Mailing' menu will allow you to e-mail
your database/collection and/or selections/miniselections from Profiles.

1. Prepare your mass mailing
----------------------------

![Prepare your mass
mailing](Copernicacom/en-massmailing.png "Prepare your mass mailing")

Select the document you would like to send in E-mailings and choose the
'*Send mass mailing*' function in under '*Mailings*'. \
 \

2. Choose the target of the mass mailing
----------------------------------------

![Choose the target of the
mailing](Copernicacom/en-target-massmailing.png "Choose the target of the mass mailing")

Select to which database/selection and possibly mini-selection you wish
to send the mailing. Check the box to exclude double mail addresses,
otherwise some contacts may receive the mailing more than once. The
description is meant as a reference to yourself for later.

 \

3. Send now or schedule for later
---------------------------------

![Schedule your mass
mailing](Copernicacom/en-schedule-massmailing.png "Schedule your mass mailing")

The email can be sent immediately, set for later or to repeat several
times (schedule for later processing). The scheduling option allows you
to enter a date and time to send the email and the possibility to repeat
the mailing periodically at an interval and frequency of your choosing.
Each time the email is sent, it will use the (sub)profiles that are in
the selection at that moment.

**Note:**You can modify your document at any time while it’s scheduled.
The modified version will be sent at the scheduled time.

4. Mass mailing options
-----------------------

![Mass mailing
options](Copernicacom/en-options-massmailing.png "Mass mailing options")

The default options are recommended for most users.

Types: If you have a text version, send both the HTML and text version.
The text version is a back-up displayed to recipients who cannot see
HTML. Otherwise you can only send the formatted version.

\
 \

-   Check *personalize* if the email contains personalization code e.g.
    Hi {\$Firstname}
-   Check *‘this is a test mailing’* if you do not want the mailing to
    be registered in the contact history of the profile.
-   Check *‘images are embedded in the mailing’* to send images along
    with the email.
-   Check *‘Cache external images’* to cache images hosted on an
    external server on the pic server used for mailings.
-   Speed: If you wish to slow down the delivery of the email, check the
    'limit the delivery' option. For example limit your delivery rate to
    prevent your website from reaching it's load capacity due to a large
    number of visits to your website at the the same time. *Note: If you
    wish to slow down the email delivery rate to avoid being listed as
    spam it's more accurately set from the admin panel.*

Optional step: Split run mailing
--------------------------------

Split run testing (often called A|B testing) enables you to create
different versions of a document for one mass mailing. The different
versions are sent to small groups of contacts, to test the effectiveness
of each version. Based on the results of the test mailings, the system
will send the most effective document to all remaining contacts.
