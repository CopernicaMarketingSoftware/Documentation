Select a mailing from the top half to see its results in the lower half.

For mobile mailings it is only possible to register whether or not the
message was successfully delivered to the Telecom gateway. These will be
registered as 'success'. When sending the messages, the application
filters valid phone numbers and strips them from spaces and characters
other than numbers. Numbers beginning with 0 are changed to +31 for
international coding.

-   **Successful**: the mobile message was successfully delivered
-   **Unknown**: we got no response about what happened.
-   **Error**: The mobile message could not be delivered. Most likely
    the number did not exists, recipient was out of reach, or the mobile
    inbox was full.

Mobile messages are also delivered to cellphones that have been
(temporarily) turned off.
