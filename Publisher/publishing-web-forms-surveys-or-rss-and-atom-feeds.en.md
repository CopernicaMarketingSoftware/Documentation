Webforms, surveys and feeds that you created within Content, are easily
published on your web page with a special code.

Note that web forms and surveys can only be included in web pages (not
in email documents). RSS and Atom feeds are also allowed in email
documents.

The code is allowed in both the template HTML source, and in any
document text block (switch ot the HTML editor).
