In some accounts it is desirable to perform all mailings from the same
sender address. These default addresses are managed and organized
under *Admin*.

Once you have added one or more 'from' addresses under Admin, users are
no longer able to use a different from address when composing their
email documents and template. The default addresses will become
available in a list when composing a new email document or template.

To see which sender addresses are made default for an account, you can
view the tab *'From' Address* in the account overview under *Admin*.

Smarty personalization is not allowed in this field.
