We're looking for highly skilled interns and graduate students who are
interested in building compilers and have experience in native languages
such as C, C++ or Assembly.

Description
-----------

Copernica develops an online software tool for marketing purposes. The
software allows users to send large volumes of emails with personalized
content. For example, a large web shop may send a product email to its
customers, tailored with their previous purchases or interests.

These emails are composed in an editor. With the use of variables users
are able to add simple personalization (Dear {\$firstname}) and more
complex instructions (if statements and foreach loops). The data used
for personalization is stored in a multilayered database customized and
maintained by users themselves. These databases easily grow to millions
of records and can contain all kinds of data.

The freedom we offer to our users allows them to create highly complex
templates (and believe us, they do). But as always, there is a downside
as well: it takes a lot of computing power. Especially when you consider
that there are millions of emails compiled each day.

Main research goal
------------------

How can we optimize the process of template conversion?

Suggestions
-----------

-   The template can be converted directly to a native code (instead of
    the scripting language as an intermediate step).
-   Variables just-in-time loading; retrieve only the relevant data from
    the database.

Key aspects
-----------

-   It should not be at the expense of the existing functionality
    (meaning that existing users do not have to learn a new syntax).
-   Most users have no or very little programming skills.

Benefits
--------

-   Intern fee and a full compensation of travel costs.
-   Our office is a 5 minutes walk from Amsterdam Central Station
-   Highly professional environment.
-   Team of passionate software developers.
-   Lots of career opportunities focused on personal development.

How to apply
------------
