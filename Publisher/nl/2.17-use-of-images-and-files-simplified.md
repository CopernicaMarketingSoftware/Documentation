# 2.17 Use of images and files simplified

You are capable of centrally organizing and managing files and images
using *media libraries *in the application. Files and images uploaded to
a media library are available for use in templates, documents, web forms
and any other publication created with the software. Until recently,
using an image required you to link the containing media library to the
publication first. This process has been simplified.

As of version 2.17, all images and files from any library created
under *Content *are accessible using the "medialibraryname/imagename"
syntax. For example: if you have a media-library named "MyLibrary", and
the image "logo.gif" is stored in this library, you can use the
"MyLibrary/logo.gif" in every publication, without first linking the
media library.
