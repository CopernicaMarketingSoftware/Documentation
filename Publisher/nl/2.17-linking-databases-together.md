In version 2.17 a new field type has been introduced: **the reference
field**. This new field type allows you to create references between
different databases and their profiles. It is the first step towards a
more flexible and powerful database system. But it is still a work in
progress. The current implementation has not proven itself to be user
friendly yet, and it is also not possible to personalize your documents
with data from the linked database. 

**How does the reference field work?**

Suppose, you have a database with companies, and a separate database
that contains the employees from those companies. You can now link the
employees to the company, by creating a reference field in the Employees
database. An employee can then be linked to the company profile by
entering the profile ID of the company in the reference field.

The employees are now linked to the company. Hence, they will appear in
the tab Employees (named after the field that is ordered by default) in
the Company database.
