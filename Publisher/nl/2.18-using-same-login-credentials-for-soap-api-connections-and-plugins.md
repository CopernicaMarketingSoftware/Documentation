# 2.18 Login credentials SOAP api and plugins

As you might have noticed, the login procedure has recently changed. As
of version 2.13 users have access to all their accounts using the same
credentials: your email address and password. However, the old login
credentials (name, account name and password) are still used for SOAP
API connections and plugins for third party software, such as Magento.
If you are still using the old credentials for the Magento extension or
any other SOAP connection, no further action is required from you.

In version 2.18 we created a solution that also enables SOAP API
connections and connections via pluginsÂ  to use the new login
credentials. These connections did not fully support the new login
procedure and new users of the software did not have these old
credentials. This issue has been solved in version 2.18.
