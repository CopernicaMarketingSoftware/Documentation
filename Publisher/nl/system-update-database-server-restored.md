Last night between 0.45 and 9.00 AM (CET), a hardware interruption
resulted in downtime for one of our database servers. Because of this,
some users weren’t able to access the application. Also, for some users
this meant emailings were sent out with a delay, and follow up actions
weren’t executed until 9.00 AM.

The hardware problem has now been solved. No data was lost during this
interruption. Our backup server has taken over and no additional actions
from our users are required.

Because our servers are now catching up and sending out delayed
emailings and executing delayed follow up actions from the last hours,
the application might be running a little slower than usual.

This might also result in slightly delayed emailings and follow up
actions that were scheduled after 9.00 AM. We expect everything to be
operating as usual later today.
