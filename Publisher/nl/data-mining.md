We are looking for ambitious interns and graduate students who are
interested in data mining and have experience in programming.

Copernica manages a large amount of data. However, the meaning of a lot
of information is unknown. During your intern-ship you’ll develop
various methods that add semantics to Copernica’s data. In some cases
you’ll have to deploy artificial intelligence, in other circumstances
you’ll simply have to offer users the possibility to specify what
information should be stored in the system.

Context of the project within the organization
----------------------------------------------

Having a better overview of data semantics enables Copernica to discover
patterns in and links between the information in the database. This is
essential for us to establish more relevant communication with existing
clients and prospects, helping us to:

-   Achieve a higher ROI and conversion with prospects and existing
    clients
-   Send relevant system alerts and product information
-   Offering better product support
-   Improve our client retention

**The problem that has to be solved**

Copernica manages a large amount of data. However, the meaning of a lot
of information is unknown. Certain information we need to establish with
our users may be available in the database, but is missing the semantics
to use it in the most efficient way possible.

Possible research questions
---------------------------

-   Is it possible to distil missing information from the apparently
    unconnected information that is available now?
-   How can I map and connect available information and create an
    overview of the way certain information relates to each other?

**Possible solutions**

-   Distil missing information from apparently unconnected information.
-   Map and connect available information and create an overview of the
    way certain information relates to each other.

Examples: {#examples:}
---------

-   Use information like zip codes, city name, and phone numbers to find
    out the country a company is located in.
-   Create a way to see which users were impacted by a certain server
    interruption by comparing the times they logged in to the software
    and the database server they use to send data.
-   Help clients that use the software to be more efficient by checking
    if they make unnecessarily complicated selections on their
    databases.
-   Compare the available information in our different databases to see
    what kind of contract a certain customer has.
-   How the quality of the solution can be tested.
-   Is the previously missing information that is being distilled
    correct? Randomly and systematically check certain profiles manually
    to verify.

How to apply
------------

Are you interested in this project and do your education and skills
match the job profile? Great! Please send an email with your CV and
motivation letter to Nikita Maione (nikita.maione@copernica.com). Before
we invite you for an interview, you may be asked to complete a job
assignment at home first.
