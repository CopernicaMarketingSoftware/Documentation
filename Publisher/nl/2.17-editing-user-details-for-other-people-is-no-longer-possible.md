# 2.17 Editing user details of others is no long possible

Users are no longer able to edit the personal details of other users
within an account. As of version 2.17 of the application, each user is
responsible for his or her own details.

If you want to edit your details, you can do so using the personal menu
at the top right corner of the screen in the menu "WelcomeÂ *Your Name*".
However, administrators are still able to manage the individual access
rights of the users within an account.
