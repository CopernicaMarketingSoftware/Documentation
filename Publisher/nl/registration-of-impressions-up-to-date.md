We have installed a new procedure in the application which makes sure
the registration of impressions is up-to-date. We will be monitoring the
new procedure to make sure the registration stays up-to-date at all
times.

Users had reported a delay in the registration of impressions when a
campaign was sent. This has now been fixed.
