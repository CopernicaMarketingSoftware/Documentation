This afternoon, 12-07-2012, one of our database servers experienced a
short downtime between 13.48 and 14.00. During this downtime, no data
was lost.Â This downtime was caused by a temporary overload of the
database server. As a result of this downtime, scheduled tasks and
sending emailings encountered a slight delay.

At this moment, the problem has been found and solved. The scheduled
tasks have been executed and the delayed emailings have been sent. There
is no need for you to perform any extra actions. The application is
functioning properly again.
