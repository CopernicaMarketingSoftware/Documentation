As a result of technical issues with our hosting party, a small amount
of our users might have experienced some difficulties reaching the
application earlier today. These issues are now solved.

This interference only affected the interface of our application, and
didnâ€™t have any impact on emailings that were already scheduled to be
sent out. Also, no data was lost during this interruption.

No additional actions from our users are required.
