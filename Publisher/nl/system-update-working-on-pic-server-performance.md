Users might experience some difficulties when using the application, due
to a server overload. We are working to solve this issue. No data will
be lost as a result of this interruption and no additional actions from
our users are needed.

To prevent this issue from happening in the future, extra pic servers
are being installed. Pic servers are used for loading web versions of
emailings, to redirect hyperlinks in your emailings and web pages and to
display images.

In addition to preventing the servers from overloading in the future,
the installation of extra pic servers will make your hyperlinks redirect
a lot quicker and the load time for images will also be significantly
shortened.
