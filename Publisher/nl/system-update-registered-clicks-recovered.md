We have successfully recovered the majority of the click data that had
not been registered between Tuesday 11:22 AM and this morning 9:40 AM
(EST). The restored data is now available in the application.

Follow up actions for registered clicks were automatically performed the
moment the click registrations were recovered. There is no need for you
to perform any additional actions.
