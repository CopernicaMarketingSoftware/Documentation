*Hi and welcome to this brand new edition of Copernica's whiteboard
session. Today we will be talking about the Copernica Partner Model.* **

Copernica Marketing Software is used by both end-users and partners.
Partners can resell Copernica towards their network. Either under a
whitelabel or under the Copernica brand. And a partner can provide value
added services. But in creating accounts, a partner can also grant full
access to the software for their customers.

Focussing on the development of generic marketing software, Copernica
does not offer services like consultancy, template development, creating
synchronizations to CRM systems or other services.

Partners however do provide these services. That is why partners are so
important for the Copernica eco-system. If an end-user has a demand for
specific services, like training, consultancy or full service campaign
management, an end-user can search in the Copernica [partner
program](http://www.copernica.com/nl/partners/registreer-je-als-partner-van-copernica "Partnerprogramma") which
is viewable from Copernica.com and the software. And in this partner
program, a reseller can advertise itself based on a profile, on cases,
on expertises and on reviews provided by end-users.

If an end-user selects a specific partner, the partner instantly
receives a kickback fee on all turnover of this specific customer of
10%. This is of course besides all the income and turnover you generate
with all these value added services you provide. 

As a partner you are not alone. Copernica supports you with all kinds of
intelligence, content and other support. The services Copernica provides
to you as a partner include
the [license](http://www.copernica.com/nl/partners/5-manieren-om-inkomsten-te-genereren "Partnerlicentie"),
the partner program, the [partner
support](http://www.copernica.com/nl/partners/haal-het-maximale-uit-de-partnerlicentie "Partnerondersteuning") and
marketing.

Focussing on the first, the license. Copernica is a software as a
service (SaaS). You as a partner can add your own accounts. Copernica
charges you a reduced fee of a maximum of 50% of our end-users fee,
allowing you to create your own pricing model. Including a margin or if
you choose to do so, without a margin with income from value added
services. Besides that, you can use the software for your own marketing
campaigns of course.

Included in the partner license is the partner program. The
advertisement towards the network of end-users. In this partner program
you can add your profile, your expertise, cases and customers can review
the services that you have provided. This will become more and more
important on the Copernica.com website.

Copernica gives you all the support you need to be successful in the
reselling of Copernica. We provide you training both on product and on
the commercial level. We provide you with sales support. Meaning, you
will have your [personal partner
manager](http://www.copernica.com/nl/partners/registreer-je-als-partner-van-copernica "Ontdek ons partnerprogramma") who
will share with you the best practices, cases and help you in the
commercial paths you will follow with your prospects. And support is
included in the license fee.

Last but certainly not least, Copernica helps you to succesfully market
the product. Either under a whitelabel or under the Copernica brand.
Well Copernica publishes a lot of content such as articles, cases, best
practices, whitepapers. You as a partner are able to use this content in
your own marketing. Of course we would appreciate it if you would link
it back to the source
([www.copernica.com](http://www.copernica.com/nl/home "Copernica Marketing Software Homepage"))
but you can use this content to show your specialization. Together we
also can organize seminars where you can personally give more
information on the services you provide. And you can participate in
events that Copernica attends. Like business fairs where you can get
your own desk on the Copernica stand where you can market your own
products and services under the Copernica flag. Finally, included in the
software is the online demo tool allowing you to give live
demonstrations to prospects from the software.

So besides the software, Copernica offers a full range of services
enabling you to succesfully market the powerful solution Copernica
Marketing Software has to offer. Because being partners, your success is
our succes!
