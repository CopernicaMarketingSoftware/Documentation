# 2.18 Change in code of generated web forms

Users who still make use of web forms created with the *Form Wizard*
under *Websites*, might be interested in the following change. This does
not apply to users who generate web forms under *Content*.

Web forms generated in version 2.18 and higher, will have a slightly
different coding than web forms created in older versions. The change
will not affect existing web forms at all, these will keep working just
as well.

However, it is advised to take into account this change to be sure your
web forms keep functioning after future releases. 

If you make use of generated web forms with the Form Wizard you need to
change two things in one single (hidden) input field:

-   The name of the hidden field. It should become *cdmaccount*instead
    of *account*
-   The value of the field

Old version:

\<input type="hidden" name="*account*" value="XXX"/\>

New version:

\<input type="hidden" name="*cdmaccount*" value="XXX"/\>

To determine the value that should be used for the *cdmaccount*, you can
(quickly) generate a new form with your form wizard and replace the line
in your existing form with the line from the new form.
