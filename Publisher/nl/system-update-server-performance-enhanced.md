We improved the application performance by installing extra pic servers.
These pic servers are used for loading web versions of emailings,
redirecting hyperlinks and for displaying images in emailings and on
webpages.

As a result of these enhancements, hyperlinks in your emailings and web
pages will redirect a lot quicker than they used to. The load time for
images and email web versions is now also significantly shortened.
