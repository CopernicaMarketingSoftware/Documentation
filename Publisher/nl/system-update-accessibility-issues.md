As a result of technical issues with IP ranges at our hosting party, a
small amount of our users might experience some difficulties reaching
the application. We are aware of this situation and working hard on a
solution.

In the meanwhile, if you have troubles loading the application, you can
try and connect using another IP address by using another wifi network
for instance. Or by sharing your mobile phone's internet connection with
your computer.

This interference only affects the interface of our application, and
won't have any impact on emailings that were already scheduled to be
sent out. Also, no data will be lost during this interruption. No
additional actions from our users are required.
