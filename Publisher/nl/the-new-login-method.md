As of release 2.13 of the application you will have noticed the new
method of logging in. As of now, you have to use your email address and
password to login to the application. This method has been introduced to
facilitate switching between different accounts. Users who only have one
account will instantly access this account when logging in. Users with
more than one account will be able to choose between accounts when
logging in.
