# Statistieken: Template statistics

You can view the statistics of a template for all its mailings. In the 
statistics you can find the amount of opens, clicks, bounces and many other things 
including the [key figures](./statistics-key-figures).

## Marketing Suite

Go to your **Mailing History** and select a document using your template. 
Go to the tab **Options** and open the full report or the template report 
to get more insight in your template. You can even [share your results](./statistics-share), 
without giving someone access to your account.

## Publisher

Select your template in the **E-mailings** tab and navigate to the **Statistics** tab. 
Here you will find all the statistics for your specific template.
