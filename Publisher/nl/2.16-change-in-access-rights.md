Account administrators are able to manage the access rights of all users
within an account. However it seems unlikely an account administrator
would lower his own access rights.

As of version 2.16 of the application, an account administrator is no
longer able to revoke his or her own access rights. When editing your
own access rights, you will find these options disabled.
