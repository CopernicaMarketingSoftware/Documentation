As of this week we are introducing new version numbers for the
application. Because the software is updated almost every week, it could
otherwise become unclear what version you are working with as a user.
 
To provide you with a better overview, we will include the year and
number of the week in our version numbers. For instance, version 12.25
concerns the software developed in week 25 in the year 2012.
 
In some rare occasions we need to perform multiple releases in the same
week. In that case, we will add an extra number: 12.25.1, 12.25.2,
etcetera. 
 
This week, we will be releasing version 12.27.
