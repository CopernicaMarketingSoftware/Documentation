Hello my fellow Copernicans,

Something happened in the MarketingSuite today. A new icon was added to
the left side menu. When this icon is clicked, a large cluster of zeros
and ones will bring you to the Database Management tool V02. In this
current version users can do a few things, which I will present to you
with a bulleted list:

-   Lookup basic information about databases and selections
-   See databases and selections
-   Edit their names and descriptions
-   Remove them from existence
-   See which mailings are sent and are scheduled to databases and
    selections

The coolest thing is the Edit Structure tool, with which users can edit
the field structure of their databases. A link to this tool is currently
found in the tab *Options* at each database. But it will get a more
prominent place in a not so distant future.

Of course lots of features are still missing. Such as creating and
managing selections and profile management. Hopefully in a next update
on this franschiser dashboard.

Also, the Mailing Statistics in the Marketing Suite have been improved.
Most notable change: the separate dialogs to manage bounces,
unsubscribes and so and so have been removed. These features have moved
to the normal overview.

If you have any comments, or suggestions for improvements, or maybe you
even found a bug, let me know.

Walter
