In the night of Saturday the 11th on Sunday the 12th of August, starting
at midnight (CET) we will be undergoing scheduled maintenance to our
servers.

Because of this maintenance, users could experience difficulties
reaching the application. Also, scheduled emails might be sent out with
some delay.

The maintenance is planned to last until about 3 AM. After that the
application will run as usual.
