Due to technical difficulties, clicks made in emailings and webpages
between Tuesday 11:22 AM and today 9:40 AM (CET) were not registered in
the application. The click registration service has now been restored.

We are still working on recovering the lost click data, and expect to be
able to successfully retrieve the majority of the data later today. The
restored data will then become available in the application.

Follow up actions for registered clicks will automatically be performed
the moment the click registrations are recovered. No additional actions
from our users are required.
