We are currently working on improving the way you work with articles in
the application.

At this moment, when you want to write an article in the application,
you have to create a content feed. But what do you do when you do not
want to use a content feed? Maybe you only want to use the article in an
emailing, on your website or in a PDF document. This is what we are
working on.

You will be able to create and categorize your content articles in the
application. After creating the articles you can choose if you want to
use one or more articles in an emailing, on your website, in a PDF
document or in a content feed.

We will also add an extra functionality with which you can easily link
an article in one language to the same article in another language. This
helps when you are working with multilingual websites.

**Introducing Pipes**

What happens if you want to put your articles in a content feed? We have
developed a new powerful feature: 'Pipes'. This is a powerful
composition tool or filter that will help you publish the content in a
content feed based on variables such as author, date, category and much
more.

The improvements on working with articles and the feature 'Pipes' will
replace the use of content feeds in time. Keep a close eye on our
product updates to see when you will be able to use these new features.
