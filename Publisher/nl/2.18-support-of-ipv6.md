# 2.18 Support of IPv6

Until now, the application was not able to register clicks or
impressions for campaigns sent via IPv6 addresses. This has been fixed
in release 2.18. As of wednesday, impressions and clicks will also be
registered if you have a domain name that uses IPv6.

IPv6 is the new version of the older IP-addresses, also known as IPv4.
These are the addresses assigned to computers used to communicate on the
internet.
