Users were not able to send a bulkmailing **manually** on 21-06-2012
between 15:00 PM and 16:00 PM.Â Due to a bug in the release of 2.18, you
were not able to send out emailings manually. This bug has already been
fixed and you are able to send out emailings properly again. We
recommend you try sending your emailing again if this did not work
between 15:00 PM and 16:00 PM.
