# 2.17 Better distinction between users

If you are using the services of a partner when using the application,
and the partner needs access to your account, he or she can be added at
no additional cost.

However, in previous versions it was not very clear if any extra costs
were involved, and there was also no visual distinction between a
partner user and a normal user. In version 2.17 this has been improved.
The partner is now recognizable as a partner user that will not be
charged.
