[Deliverability](http://www.copernica.com/en/about-us/news/deliverability-better-email-delivery-with-copernica)
involves practically everything that is of influence when it comes to
delivering an email to your recipient's inbox: Internet Service
Providers (ISP's), Mail Transfer Agents (MTA's), bounces, spam reports,
spam filters, junk mail, delivery settings...and much more. However,
don't forget that as an email sender you fully control the
deliverability of your emails. As long as you send good relevant emails
and maintain a clean database and address list, your emails will gain
easier access to the inbox of your recipients.

Use Copernica's spam check to monitor the [spam
rating](http://www.copernica.com/en/about-us/news/reduce-your-spam-rating-some-focus-points)
of your emails. The higher your spam rating, the more likely your emails
will be filtered into the Spamfolder. So pay extra attention to the
following points:

-   The balance between text and images: try to use at least one
    paragraph of text per image
-   Send along a text version of your email
-   Use an existing from-address & use a short and relevant subject line
-   Avoid the use of spam sensitive words or excessive use of capitals
    or exclamation marks
