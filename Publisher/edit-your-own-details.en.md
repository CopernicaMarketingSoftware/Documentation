A user can only change his or her own data. You'll find the option in
your personal menu in the top right corner of the application. Besides
your name and address, you can also specify whether you want to be
notified about software updates and maintanance.

The personal data is visible to all users of the accounts to which you
have access. Account administrators cannot change the data of others.

### Set preferred language

The application is available in French, Dutch, English and German. The
display language can be changed directly by clicking on a flag in the
top right of the application. If you want to display the application in
another language by default, you can set this via 'Welcome *your
name*-\> *Edit your details*'.

### Change password

Users can change their password. This option can be found in the
**Personal menu**. A user can only change his or her own password.

### Forgot your password?

If you have forgotten your password then you can request a new password
from the login page. A new password will be sent to the specified email
address.

### Test destination

If you use [Smarty
personalisation](./personalize-campaigns.en.md)
and / or javascript conditions in your publications than it is previewed
in the application with the data from the profile or subprofile set as
[test
destination](./what-is-the-test-destination.en.md).

Also test mails are sent to the test destination. Each user within an
account has his or her own test destination, which can be set from your
personal menu. The test destination can be changed at any time. The test
destination can also be set at the (sub) profile itself under
**Profiles**.

### Personal picture

Each user can upload his or her own profile picture. Your picture can
only be admired by others in the Admin module, right next to your name.
