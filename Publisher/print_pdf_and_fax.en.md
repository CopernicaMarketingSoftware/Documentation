Copernica allows you to create PDF documents for fax mailings, advertisements, brochures and other printed material. Or more importantly create personalized PDF documents to send in e-mailings.

To create personalized PDF files you need Adobe Acrobat Pro and the free plugin from PDFlib.

Note: The plugin doesnâ€™t work with Acrobat Elements or any version of Adobe Reader.

Fonts you use in your blocks must be uploaded to Copernica. Otherwise, text is not displayed at all.
