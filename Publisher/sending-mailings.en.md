The first time you send an emailing can be an exciting moment. Will it
all go as planned? Is your emailing going to be delivered to the people
intended and how will they respond? Luckily you arrived at the right
place. This article addresses all subjects on successfully sending mass
mailings with Copernica.

### Test before sending

You don't want to find out that you just sent a big grammatical boo boo
to thousands of people, or that the email looks horrible in Gmail and
that your *call to action* link doesn't work at all. It is all a matter
of testing, folks. Testing extensively.
