Most HTML emails contain images as well. Images and files can be stored
in the Files and Images folder (belonging to the template or document)
or in a Media Library. It is also possible to use images hosted on a
server elsewhere.

-   Files and images uploaded to the **template** are available in the
    template and in all underlying documents
-   Files and images uploaded to the **document** are only available in
    the document
-   Files and images uploaded to a **media library** can be used in all
    publications (templates, documents, webforms, surveys, feeds)

![Files and images folder](images/filesandimages.png)

in the linked media library can be used in the document, template,
survey et cetera.

If your template uses images blocks (most template do) you can add an
image to the document as follows:

1.  Go to **document edit mode**
2.  Click on an image block.
3.  Click on **Choose image**to select an image already uploaded to the
    document or template images folder
4.  Choose **upload image** to upload an image from your computer.

    configure additional options for the image.
