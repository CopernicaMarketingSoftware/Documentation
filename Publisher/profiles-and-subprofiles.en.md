When working in Copernica, you will frequenly come across the terms
profiles and subprofiles. Both represent one set of data. The only
difference: profiles exist on database level, subprofiles exists in
**collection** level, and are always directly related to a profile.

One set of data in a database we call a **profile**. A profile can for
example represent one subscriber to your newsletter. The profile is then
used to store his email address, name, newsletter preferences et cetera.

A **subprofile** is an extra layer of data connected to a profile. For
example if your profiles are companies, the subprofiles could be people
working at that company or products purchased at that company. Each
person or product makes up for one subprofile, but you can add multiple
subprofiles to one profile.
