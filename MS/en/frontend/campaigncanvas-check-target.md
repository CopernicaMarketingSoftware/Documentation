This box can be used to check if the (sub)profile has certain values set.
By default, it will use the (sub)profile that started the followup, but it's
possible to explicitly say to use a profile (when database/selection was
used) or subprofile (when collection/mini selection was used).

Besides checking fields or interests it's also possible to check for
a custom value set on a (sub)profile. This custom value is a value set in
the [*data property*][data-property] of the (sub)profile.
