This box can be used to change the (sub)profile data.  You can change a field
data or an interest data or set a custom property. This custom property will
be set in (sub)profile's [*data property*][data-property].

By default, it will use the (sub)profile that started the followup, but it's
possible to explicitly say to use a profile (when database/selection was used)
or subprofile (when collection/mini selection was used).
