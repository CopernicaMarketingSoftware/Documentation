If you no longer actively use a database or selection, you can choose to archive them rather than removing them. An archived database or selection will no longer be visible until you specifically choose to show them.

Archiving inactive databases and selections will speed up your account, because databases and selections are no longer rebuilt once they're archived, and thus leaving more of the available resources to their non-archived counterparts.
