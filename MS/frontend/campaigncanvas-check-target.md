This box can be used to check if (sub)profile has certain values set. By
default it will use the (sub)profile that started the followup, but it's
possible to explicitly say to use a profile (when database/selection was
used) or subprofile (when collection/mini selection was used).

Beside checking fields or interests it's also possible to check for
a custom value set on a (sub)profile. This custom value is value set on
the data property of the (sub)profile. Read more about data property here.
